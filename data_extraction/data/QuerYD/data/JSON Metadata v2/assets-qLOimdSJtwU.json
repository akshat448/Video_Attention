Thanks!I \nSlime was a toy product manufactured by pillo, sold in a plastic trash can and introduced in the winter of 1976. It consisted of a non-toxic viscous, squishy and oozy green or other color material made primarily from guar gum.[1] Different variations of Slime were released over the years, including Slime containing rubber insects, eyeballs, and worms and Masters of the Universe Slime for Hordak's Slime Pit playset in the 1980s.\nThe late 1970s also introduced a Slime Monster board game; the object of the game was to avoid having your game piece slimed on by a foot-tall plastic monster that had slime oozing from its mouth. Other toy companies have produced their own slime such as the Ecto-Plazm play gel[2] sold with select figures in Kenner's Real Ghostbusters toyline. Playmates' Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles figure line also had Retro-Mutagen slime sold in containers and included with playsets.\nhe main components are the polysaccharide guar gum and sodium tetraborate. As an alternative to the polysaccharide, other alcohol-group containing polymers (such as polyvinyl alcohol) may be used to a similar result. These non-polysacharide polymer products are more often referred to as flubber.\nPolyvinyl acetate (Elmer's glue), borax and water can also be used to approximate Slime's characteristics.\nPlease join to my channel from link below;\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCncW1mTN8mgKo4g9D8im-_A \n\nHoppiTV : \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRzJw3ZtTiQJNAAGxzH-2dQ \nFunnyKids TV : \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UClwXPc317YSIXbSxYREy5Lg \n\nbesides Easy Slime only in 2 Minutes , HAVE YOU SEEN MY PREVIOUS VIDEOS?! \nHow to make Slime Without Glue, Real Without Glue Slime, No Glue\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWKFfUtUBI \nDIY Rubber Band Slime , How to Make Crunchy Slime with Rubber Band, Most Satisfying Crunchy Slime\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrM9iQSsGeo \nHow to Make Black Fluffy Slime Without Glue, DIY Real No Glue Slime, Black Slime\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgLas1Ew8VE \nEasy Basic Slime Tutorial, Three Ways !!! , How To Make Basic Slime For Beginners!!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wHenmF_rHI \nHow to Make Slime Without Glue, DIY Real No Glue Slime\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D78qbrN7ons&t=32s \nHow to make Giant Fuffy Slime with Dish Soap, without Shaving Cream, Easy to Make\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FBVMTO2IZU \nHow to make Crazy Jiggly Slime, Crazy Slime Recipe, Easy to Make https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srSrXG20tQc \nDIY Kinetic Sand Slime, How to make Slime with Kinetic Sand, Crazy Sand Slime\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ew2_C_1EYg \nLive!!
