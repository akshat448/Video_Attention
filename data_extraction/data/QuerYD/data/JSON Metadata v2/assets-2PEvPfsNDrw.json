I could never have done this by myself.\n\nConnection\n\nBy the time I met Mike I knew what I was looking for. We had our first interview and it was phenomenal!\n\nJason, Employer\n\nIt was probably the best interview I ever conducted.\n\nWith his career experience in the military he was a natural fit.\n\nAfter spending 20 years in the military learning specific skills I wasn't sure I could have a career on the outside.\n\nThe world had changed quite a bit.\n\nMike, Job Seeker\n\nThe Pikes Peak Workforce Center provided me with a career assessment.\n\nThey help me understand my transferable skills that made the best use of my military experience.\n\nRight skills, right time.\n\nGet more of what you want in your interviews and it all starts with compatibility.\n\nThe Pikes Peak Workforce Center really gets to know your business\n\nand then gives you a choice of candidates who are highly compatible for your opening.\n\nThat saves time from the first interview onward.\n\nSee how it feels to be matched based on compatibility.\n\nLog on  PPWFC.org Business Services today\n\nPaid from the Workforce Investment Act 10% Statewide Activity Fund\n",
