                "notes": "A black and white photo of a man stepping on the pavement is shown with a quote by Francis Bacon in Novum Organum in 1620.\n\"\"\n\nA woman sitting in a room greets the viewer.\nThe live video is powered by Zoom.\n\nSally Mann appears in a live video besides Sarah Meister. She sits in a gallery or office with several pieces of artwork displayed behind her. \n\nTwo black and white photographs are shown. First is The Defendant by Dorothea Lange, taken at the Alameda County Courthouse in California in 1955-57. It shows a man with his hand over his head as if in grief. He sits in a courthouse in front of a table.\nThe second photo is Ponder Heart by Sally Mann. It was taken in 2009. It shows the view of a man from the backside. He seems to be standing or sitting outside where it is raining. \n\nThe camera zooms in to the man with his head in his hands in The Defendant and the barely visible view of the man's hand in Ponder Heart. \n\nA photo of Damaged Child by Dorothea Lange appears on the screen. It was taken at Shacktown, Elm Grove, Oklahoma in August 1936. It shows a black and white photograph of a little girl with dirt and soot on  her face and ragged clothes. It is difficult to see pupils in her eyes, they look like black hollow caves. She wears an expression of defiance and sorrow.\n\nThe screen then shows an untitled black and white photograph by Sally Mann taken in 1985. Her daughter lies on the ground with one eye closed. Her hands are behind her head and she wears chiffon. \n\nAn untitled black and white photograph by Sally Mann taken in 1985 again shows her daughter. Her hair is cut short and one of her eyes seems swollen and halfway closed. She wears a beaded necklace and a plaid dress with lace. Her face expresses depth and sorrow. \n\nThe second take of Mann's photograph is titled Damaged Child. Her daughter this time wears a fierce but sorrowful expression. \n\nSally Mann holds up a thin slip of white paper. \n\n",
