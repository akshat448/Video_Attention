                "notes": "I 0:00 Southeastern Guide Dogs Presents\n\nI 0:03 A small building that says \"CANINE UNIVERSITY\" on it stands inside a fenced area. Outside of the fenced area are trees, open plains, and a small construction project.\n\nE 0:10 Just outside of the open gate, a small white dog standing in front of an open walkway is shown. There is a statue of a dog labeled \"ACE\" with a blue cape that is located down the walkway, and behind that are the doors to the buildings.\n\nI 0:15 As the white dog walks ahead, 4 larger dogs race by him. Startled, the dog stops for a moment, but continues along.\n\nI 0:23 The dog walks into the building, and passes through the main entry with a double staircase on two sides and an empty hallway in the middle. The small white dog now passes through a hallway with a variety of posters and newspapers hanging on the wall. These papers have pictures of dogs and headlines of something related about dogs.\n\nE 0:39 All of a sudden, the dog is stopped by a hand, belonging to a woman in a blue shirt. She stands in front of shut doors, and points at a height measuring tool.\n\nI 0:45 The dog walks over to the height measuring device. However, the dog is too short and can't reach the height. The woman stares at the dog, unsatisfied.\n\nE 0:53 The dog raises an ear, which reaches the height. The woman dressed in blue notions the dog into the shut doors, and the dog excitedly pantings and jumps around in circles.\n\nI 0:54 The screen now reads \"Pip\"\n\nE 0:59 Multiple dogs are in a classroom setting, with desks. The woman in blue points to a drawing on the blackboard.\n\nE 1:01 Now, every dog raises a paw, but the white dog, too short to raise a paw over the desk, tries to jump up.\n\nI 1:04 In another scene, the woman in blue blindfolds herself, and she is led through a series of obstacles by this small white dog. However, when they reach the bollards, she falls on the ground!\n\nE 1:13 Now in another scene, a series of dogs line up to fill up their food bowl. The first dog in line presses a lower button to release its food into its bowl, and then presses the higher button to stop the food from coming out.\n\nE 1:14 Next in line is our small white dog, who successfully presses the lower button to release the food. However, when the food starts overflowing, the dog reaches for the higher button, but is incapable of doing so.\n\nI 1:18 Now the same series of scenes are repeated. In the obstacle course, the woman in blue falls again because of the white dog.\n(pause) The dog still struggles to raise its paw when all the other dogs can. The small dog falls over.\n(pause) Food continues to overflow.\n\nI 1:27 The blindfolded woman trips again. While on the ground, she removes her blindfold and glares at the startled dog.\n\nI 1:32 Now it is considerably darker in the building, and the dog stands in front of the posters and newspapers from before.\n\nI 1:35 While looking at these papers, the dog notices a picture of a small dog, surrounded by four considerably larger dogs. On the picture, it reads \"ACE LEADS THE PACK\"\n\nE 1:40 Our small white dog looks at this, and  its eyes brighten up. It smiles a little with a newfound hope.\n\nE 1:43 It's daytime again, and the dog stands in front of the food release machine. It presses the lower button, but jumps up and quickly presses the higher button, thus stopping the food.\n\nI 1:45 In the classroom, the dog sits on a couple of books and easily raises its paw.\n\nI 1:48 The dog leads the woman in blue around the obstacles and stops before a bump. The woman removes her blindfold and pets the dog lovingly.\n\nE 1:57 Several dogs, including our own white dog, are sitting in a room in one corner. At the top of the room is a sign that reads, \"EXAM DAY\", and within the room is a track with several cones, bollards, bumps, and even a trash can. The woman in a blue shirt stands in the middle of this track. At the back is a man in a suit at an elevated desk. He holds a coffee.\n\nI 2:02 The man beckons a dog forward, and our white dog steps up.\n\nE 2:06 The man approves with a grunt, and the woman in blue puts on the dog's leash. The two walk around the track in front of an audience of dogs and the man.\n\nI 2:12 The dog smiles and looks up at the blindfolded woman, but right then, they walk over the bump, which is right in front of the man's desk! The woman falls over, causing the man to fall over as well. The woman in blue glares at the dog, and then the man also glares at the dog.\n\nI 2:22 The front doors of the building open and the dog is pushed out. The dog looks down and walks away, dejected. It walks on the walkway, to the dog statue with a blue cape labeled \"ACE\". The dog briefly looks up, but then focuses its view on a blind woman with a purse and a blind pole, just outside of the locked gates surrounding the building.\n\nI 2:37 Ashamed, the dog walks back to the building and looks in the window, where the rest of the dogs stand in a line in front of the woman in blue and the man, looking proud. A tear falls on the window.\n\nI 2:48 Suddenly, in the construction site just outside the gates is a truck rolling in. In addition, the blind woman is stuck in the construction site!\n\nI 2:51 Our determined dog runs out and is able to squeeze through the gate because of its size. Quickly, the dog, using the purse as a leash, leads the helpless woman over a large hole that has nothing but a small bridge of planks over it.\n\nI 3:08 The dog stops in front of the sidewalk, and the woman steps over the bump from the construction site to the sidewalk. The woman bends down as to pet the dog, and in the distance, the woman in blue claps alongside the other dogs.\n\nI 3:20 Our dog, with a smile, makes its way over to the woman in blue. Then, the male judge pulls down the cape from the ACE dog statue, and awards it to our white dog.\n\nI 3:30 The small white dog jumps and smiles, and poses as the ACE dog statue is posing.\n\nE 3:39 The screen now reads:\n\nI 3:39 Our dogs save the day, every day, for people with vision loss and veterans with disabilities. Southeastern Guide Dogs.\n\nI 3:47 Credits",
