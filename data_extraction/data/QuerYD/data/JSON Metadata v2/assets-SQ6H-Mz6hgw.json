Lawyer, Advocate, Scholar\r\n\r\nThe video then opens to Michelle Alexander, a middle aged black woman on stage in a large auditorium. The stage is decorated with white circles connected with black lines and a sign reads Tedx Columbus. During the video the camera perspective will shift between a view of the stage and a view of the audience. There are no visual aids utilized during the presentation other than subtle emphasis given through non-verbals. All non-verbal queues are consistent with presenter audio. \r\n",

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",
