He starts a chopping motion up and down with the knife. This is what makes the tapping sound. He continues tap chopping, hardly even looking down at the knife. \r\n\r\n7:57 Rock chopping\r\nJamie puts his knife vertically on the chopping board and places his left palm flat and horizontal on top of the knife at the end of the blade. He then rocks the knife blade up and down on the board, his palm never leaves contact with the blade and the blade always keeps contact with the board. \r\n\r\n7:59 Cross chopping\r\nThis is identical to rock chopping but Jamie rocks the knife blade up and down AND left to right across the board, his palm never leaves contact with the blade and the blade always keeps contact with the board. \r\n\r\n8:29\r\nJamie puts his knife vertically on the chopping board and places his left palm flat and horizontal on top of the knife at the end of the blade. He then tilts the knife blade left and right to scrape across the board.\r\n\r\n8:58\r\nJamie demonstrates cross chopping and scraping with some herbs, tap chopping with pieces of ginger and garlic and then cross chopping and scraping all of the ingredients together.\r\n\r\n9:57 Jamie neatly scrapes all of his chopped ingredients to the right side of the chopping board\r\n\r\n10:15 Jamie starts tap chopping some courgettes with fingers tucked in on top of the courgettes. As he tap chops, his fingers gradually move back across the courgette. He moves his fingers quickly getting thicker courgette slices. He moves his fingers back very slightly and slowly getting much finer slices.\r\n\r\n11:24 The courgette is rolling around because of its shape, so Jamie slices a section of the bottom to give it a flat surface and then continues tap chopping.\r\n\r\n11:58 Jamie starts tap chopping the yellow pepper slice but the skin snags. So he uses the rock chopping technique as described earlier, but with his fingers tucked in and touching the side of the blade. He rock chops the pepper, mushrooms and some chilli without looking down at the knife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
