        "description": "I'm loving my new job at Starbucks and today wanted to share some wisdom with y'all about a few tips that I've picked up so far. These are just my own opinions for how I've been able to survive the minimum wage grind with a smile, so even if you don't work at Starbucks you can definitely get something from this video!\n\nI really hope you enjoy, please leave a comment and SUBSCRIBE if you liked me :)\n\nGetting started at Starbucks can seem really intimidating. You're learning TONS of new information nearly every second, and as a new hire it can be overwhelming. You might be struggling to ring up a customer's order or dreading being asked to be \"on bar\" making drinks when you barely know how to steam milk - and how many shots are in a grande??? Don't stress it, but definitely do sweat it out and put in the hard work your first month and you'll feel really great! Basically have lots of initiative and a great attitude and you're set - as in anything in life. Peace & love.\n\nInstagram @catcelaojo",
