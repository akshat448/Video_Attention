        "description": "From the imdb.com message boards: \n\n TIME magazine, the Nation and a few other publications gave favorable reviews but the political climate was such in 1953-54 that professional people were afraid to come too close; in addition, it soon became impossible to see the picture. Between the film projector's boycott, and that of the distributors who would threaten a theatre owner that he would get no more movies if he tried to show SALT. The cooperation of the FNI was almost superfluous in getting rid of SALT. On occasions there was a tiny art of film house where the owner ran the project and was not dependant on Hollywood films (Paramount, Fox, MGM, Warners, etc.) the FBI would make its warning visit.\n\nThis blackout continued until the early 60's, approximately ten years, although SALT had been acclaimed abroad, winning honors in France and Scotland, being dubbed into other languages, including Chinese. However, it took the student movement, the fightback against HUAC in SF [San Francisco] and Berkeley, the rising women's movement, Viet Nam, La Raza, Black Panthers -- all, all the great human movements associated in the United States with the 60's to bring SALT to life in America. It served many aspects of these movements: class, national oppression, women, minorities, revolution -- and best of all, humankind through love, a demonstration of the best in all of us.\n\nWith all its flaws -- and they are there -- SALT turned out to be far more meaningful than its creators could ever have hoped.\n\nAlmost universal in its appeal, creation of disparate forces, this film will continue to make a statement to and about out country for years to come.\"",
