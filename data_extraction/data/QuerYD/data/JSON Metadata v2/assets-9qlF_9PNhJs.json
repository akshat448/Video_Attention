Read Simon's true story here - https://simonscat.com/blog/teddygoesmissing/ \n\nThe Tree is a classic example of when life imitates art, then art imitates real life! Simon drew this gag in one of his books, only for it to happen to him in real life a few years later. Ask him, he has the scars to prove it! \n\nSIMON'S CAT YOUTUBE CHANNEL IS 10 YEARS OLD! - Send us your birthday messages! - #SimonsCat10Years. \n\n\u2018The Tree\u2019 Credits:\nDirected by: Simon Tofield\nAnimation: Harry Slinger-Thompson, Rachel Thorn\nAnimation Supervisor: Rachel Thorn\nLayout: Jack Sleeman\nDesign/Rig: Trevor Phillips\nArt Director: Liza Nechaeva\nProducer: Emma Burch\nAssociate Producer: Edwin Eckford\nProduction Coordinator: Cathryn Gamble\nMusic: Shrooty\nFoley: Chris Swaine @ Fonic\n\nLove Simon\u2019s Cat?

What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Animation is a slow process and Simon\u2019s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon\u2019s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from our online shop! - https://shop.simonscat.com/",
