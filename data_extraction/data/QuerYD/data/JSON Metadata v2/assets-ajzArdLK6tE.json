        "description": "Here is what you'll need!\r\n\r\nHomemade Pickles 3-ways\r\nMakes 3 quarts of pickles \r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT \r\n3 quart-sized, wide-mouth mason jars with lids\r\n\r\nINGREDIENTS\r\nDill Pickles\r\nBrine\r\n1 cup water\r\n\u00bd cup white vinegar\r\n1 tablespoon salt\r\n1 tablespoon sugar\r\n1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns\r\n1 teaspoon caraway seed\r\n1\u00bd teaspoon dill seed\r\n\r\n12 Kirby cucumber spears (3 cucumbers quartered lengthwise)\r\n3 sprigs fresh dill\r\n1 whole clove garlic\r\n\r\nBread & Butter Pickles\r\nBrine\r\n\u00bd cup white vinegar\r\n\u00bd apple cider vinegar\r\n\u00bc cup water\r\n1 cup sugar\r\n1 tablespoon salt\r\n1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns\r\n1 teaspoon dry mustard \r\n3-4 whole cloves\r\n1 teaspoon celery seed\r\n\u00bd teaspoon turmeric\r\n\r\nKirby cucumber slices (about 3 cucumbers sliced \u00bc-inch thick)\r\nSliced red chili\r\n\r\n\r\nSpicy Pickles\r\nBrine\r\n1 cup white vinegar\r\n\u00bd cup water\r\n1 tablespoon salt\r\n1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns\r\n1 teaspoon red pepper flakes\r\n1 teaspoon caraway seed\r\n\u00bd teaspoon dry mustard \r\n\r\n12 Kirby cucumber spears (3 cucumbers quartered lengthwise)\r\n1 jalape\u00f1o pepper, quartered\r\n1 whole clove garlic\r\n\r\nPREPARATION\r\nFill a large stock-pot with water and bring to a boil. Carefully submerge mason jars with their tops in the boiling water and keep them submerged for at least 5 minutes until ready to use. \r\nCombine brine ingredients in a medium-sized saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and allow brine to simmer for 2-4 minutes before removing from heat. \r\nThoroughly wash all herbs and vegetables (cucumbers in this case) you intend to pickle before cutting them into the desired shape and size. \r\nCarefully place and arrange the herbs and vegetables inside of the mason jar. \r\nPour the warm brine over the vegetables until the mason jar is just about full, making sure to completely submerge the items you want to get pickled. Seal the jar while the brine is still warm and allow to cool completely before placing in the fridge. \r\nThe pickles will reach their peak readiness in 10 days to 2 weeks and can be stored for up to two months.\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\r\n\r\nMUSIC\r\nPeople Like Us\r\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\r\n\r\nCreated by https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/13191",
