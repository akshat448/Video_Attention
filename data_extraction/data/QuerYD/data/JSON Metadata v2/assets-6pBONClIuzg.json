        "description": "VENOM Extended Trailer #2\r\nWatch the #Venom teaser trailer 2 now. 10.5.18. \u25bc\r\n\r\nTom Hardy, who is said to be a \"Venom\" fan, will play Eddie Brock, the character who first became Venom. First appearing in the comic book series as an alien costume worn by Spider-Man in Marvel\u2018s \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man\u201d, it was several years before the creature left Peter Parker and merged with photographer Eddie Brock, forming the antihero known as Venom.\r\nThe film is based on not one but TWO comic book storylines: 'Venom: Lethal Protector' and 'Planet of the Symbiotes.'\r\n\r\nVenom is an upcoming American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, produced by Columbia Pictures and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing.\r\n\r\nAre you excited for #Venom2018 [Leave a Like]?\r\nPlease do share!\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2716 Subscribe to Smasher for more trailers!\u25bahttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TrolleySmasher\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2716 Follow us on Twitter!\r\n\u25bahttp://www.twitter.com/SmasherAf\r\n\r\n\u2716 LIKE us on Facebook!\r\n\u25bahttp://www.facebook.com/SmasherAfk\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\r\n\r\n\u2716 Big thanks to FYROSAND for the amazing music score!\r\n\u25bahttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuxKdibVM4x0AZKc3MARUbQ\r\n\r\n\u2716 Credit to @adam_sean_arts for the awesome edited thumbnail image!\r\n\u25bahttps://www.instagram.com/isatonic/\r\n\r\n\r\nThe teaser trailer for Venom has crawled its way online.\r\n\r\nThe first spin-off movie in Sony\u2019s proposed Marvel universe, Venom stars Tom Hardy as antihero Eddie Brock, whose body is possessed by the titular alien symbiote, giving him Spider-Man-like powers. Zombieland\u2019s Ruben Fleischer has directed the film, which is rumored to be receiving an R-rating in the US, rather than the typical PG-13 rating received by most superhero films.\r\n\r\nWhile Venom\u2019s teaser trailer doesn\u2019t contain any moments graphic enough to confirm an R-rating, its dark and somber tone does suggest something more adult than the teen-movie spirit of the most recent film in the franchise, Spider-Man: Homecoming. Entirely missing from the trailer, however, is the film\u2019s title character, with Brock only glimpsed in human form rather than in his full mutated glory.\r\n\r\nOne of the more popular characters in the Spider-Man comics, Venom has been a more marginal figure in the big-screen adaptations of the web-slinger, only making its debut appearance in 2007\u2019s Spider-Man 3, where he was depicted by Topher Grace. A standalone Venom film has been in development for over a decade. Tom Holland's Spider-Man is also rumoured to star in the 2018 Venom movie.\r\n\r\nVenom is scheduled to be released in the UK and US on 5 October.\r\n\r\n\"Venom\" is a 2018 movie made by Marvel Studios as a spinoff of the 2017 film Spider-Man: Homecoming. It is the first movie of MCU Phase 4. It serves as a prequel to Homecoming revealing Venom's origins. It adapts an episode from the 1994 Spider-Man animated series.\r\n\r\nVenom marks the very beginning of \u201cSony\u2019s Marvel Universe,\u201d a cinematic setting of dubious definition. Sony has insisted that Venom will take place in the same setting as 2017\u2019s Spider-Man: Homecoming, which takes place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel, on the other hand, has insisted that Venom is not a part of the MCU.\r\n\r\nTom Hardy, who was nominated for an Oscar for his work in The Revenant, is in final negotiations to star in Venom as Eddie Brock, while Ruben Fleischer, best known for directing Zombieland, is final negotiations to helm the movie project centering on one of Spider-Man\u2019s signature villains. The character is an alien symbiote that needs a human host to survive. The project is one of Sony\u2019s top priorities and the studio is not wasting time as the movie is set to open Oct. 5, 2018. Venom is to usher in a host of movies from Sony's Marvel and Spider-Man-based universe of characters (we could even see a Carnage movie, Tom Holland as the black symbiote Spider-Man or in the Iron Spider Suit we seen in Spider-Man Homecoming). \r\n\r\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\r\n\r\nVenom,Tom Hardy Venom,Marvel's Venom,Venom trailer,Venom 2018 trailer,Venom teaser trailer,marvels Venom trailer,Tom Hardy Venom trailer 2018,Venom solo movie trailer,venom end credits,Venom tom hardy movie,Marvel's Venom tom hardy,Tom Hardy Venom trailer,Venom official trailer,Official Venom trailer,Marvel's Venom official trailer,Tom Hardy Venom movie trailer,Venom 2018,Marvel's Venom official trailer, Spider-Man: Homecoming  2, Spider-Man: Homecoming 2 trailer, Spider-Man: Homecoming 2 movie trailer, Infinity War spiderman death, spiderman 2019, spiderman trailer 2019, Infinity War spiderman suit, Peter Parker death infinity war, Tom Holland Death infinity war, new spiderman 2019, Spider-Man multiverse movie, Spider-Man multiverse, Spider-Man spiderverse movie, Spider-Man spiderverse movie trailer, thanos peter parker, Avengers Infinity War Spider-Man death, Avengers Infinity War X-Men, Infinity War X-men, Wolverine Infinity War, Venom trailer 2,Venom official trailer 2, Trailer 2, Sony Venom, Tom Hardy full venom trailer, New venom trailer",
