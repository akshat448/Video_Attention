She instructs him to put on a paper gown and then she leaves.  \n\nMr. Monk puts on the paper gown and looks at the clock in the room. \n\nThe exam room is filled with counters, cabinets, exam bed, shelves with books, a X-ray film of a chest, and a phone.\n\nMr. Monk starts looking around the room. He organizes the objects the counters and straightens up the books on the shelves.\n\nThe phone starts to ring.  Mr. Monk picks up the phone, but he only untangles the cord and hangs it back up.  \n\nMr. Monk notices 7 tubes of blood on the counter below the X-ray film.  The blood in the tubes are uneven.  Mr. Monk puts gloves on and begins to pour the blood to make all 7 tubes even with each other.  The doctor comes in and states that everything is in order.  \n\nThe video flashes to a different room.  The doctor is an elder couple.  The doctor states that their blood tests are back in and they are both pregnant.  The woman slaps her husband on the arm.  The man just laughs.",
