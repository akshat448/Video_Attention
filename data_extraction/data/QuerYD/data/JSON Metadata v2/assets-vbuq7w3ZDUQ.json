                "notes": "The Disney castle and logo appears, as a shooting star crosses over the peak of the castle.\n\nThen, the Pixar logo appears across the screen, the \"I\" of Pixar being an animated or anthropomorphic lamp that turns to face us.\n\nNow we see the night ocean, the starry sky taking up most of the screen, and the calm dark water flowing below. This is an animated film.\n\nA boat called \"La Luna\" enters from the left, moving across the water and filling the entire screen.\n\nWe see the wonder-filled face of a little boy, who is light-skinned and perhaps Italian.\n\nThen the shot transitions to a bird's-eye view of the boat, so we can see the bearded, hunched over grandfather, the little boy, and the boy's large father sitting in the boat. The father sits backwards on the bow of the boat, rowing. They are each dressed in white shirts and overalls, the father and grandfather wearing brown Breton caps.\n\nWe see a few different shots of the boat rowing, from a higher bird's eye view and then a side angled shot.\n\nNow, looking close up at the boat, the grandfather hands the boy a wrapped parcel. The father gestures for the boy to open it.\n\nThe boy opens the parcel and finds a brown Breton cap like that of his father and grandfather. He puts it on, and the grandfather immediately adjusts the cap to tilt it upward. The father throws his hands up in an exasperated gesture and turns the boy toward him, tilting the cap down.\n\nThe grandfather and father fight over the position of the cap.\n\nFinally, the boy sits next to the grandfather at the stern of the boat, and the father and grandfather both sit with their arms crossed, dissatisfied.\n\nThe camera zooms out and the boat sits in the middle of the water, still. The boy crosses his arms like his father and grandfather, and copies their minute masculine gestures of frustration.\n\nAll of a sudden, the boy gasps and turns, and the camera pans to the horizon as the moon peaks above the water, huge and luminous. The boy looks in amazement.\n\nThe moon continues to rise, framing the tiny boat, filling the screen with glowing peachy-yellow.\n\nThe father stands and offers his son the boat's anchor, then begins lifting a ladder from the bow of the boat, which ascends higher and higher until he sets it in place and gestures for his son to come forward.\n\nThe grandfather encourages the nervous son, who attaches the boat's anchor to his back, and moves to climb the ladder.\n\nHe climbs and climbs and climbs, high into the sky, nervous but encouraged by his grandfather.\n\nThe camera zooms out and we see the boy high in the sky, near the bottom lip of the moon, tiny against the vastness of the moon and its surroundings.\n\nAs he reaches the top of the ladder, gravity flips, up becoming down, and the is pulled toward the moon, floating. \n\nHe plunks onto the moon's surface, and we see that the moon is covered in small glowing stars, which look like they're made of yellow and orange glass. The boy surveys the moon, amazed.\n\nHe is startled by the call of his father, who gestures for the boy to set the anchor in the ground so they can come up to the moon, too. The boy sets the anchor in a crater full of stars.\n\nThe father and grandfather ascend the ladder, and as they do, the boy sees a shooting star fall and hit the surface of the moon. He runs over to it curious, and taps its surface.\n\nThen the boy reconvenes with his father and grandfather. The father walks over to a kind of shed that has just appeared, and pulls out a cart full of tools. The father and grandfather commence sweeping the stars on the surface of the moon.\n\nThe boy's father hands him a broom, but as he does, the grandfather comes over with his own broom to show the boy how to sweep. He hands the boy the broom, and the boy stands looking toward the camera, holding two brooms, uncertain of which to use. The father and grandfather fight over which broom the boy should use, and the boy stands still.\n (am here)\nAs they fight, the boy notices the surface of the moon shaking, and all three of them leap away as they see a huge star hurtling toward them. \n\nThe huge star lands, and the three of them stare at it, massive against the night sky. They stand, and gesture toward the star.\n\nWe jump a bit forward in time to the father and grandfather trying to move and unearth the star, broken tools scattered around them. They are tired and frustrated.\n\nThen, the boy moves slowly toward the star, and taps it. He flips his cap around with resolve, grabs a hammer, and begins to climb the giant star. The father and grandfather stop fighting and watch him.\n\nAt the top of the star, the boy listens carefully to the star, and then taps once on its tip with his hammer. \n\nAs he does so, the star breaks into hundreds of little stars, and the father and grandfather gaze on with wonder. The boy and all of the smaller stars fall slowly to the ground, landing in a pile.\n\nAll three of them laugh at each other, looking glad and relieved.\n\nThey all begin sweeping stars again, in concert, until the surface and craters of the moon are exposed and cleared of stars.\n\nTime jumps again, and we see the three of them back in the boat, off of the moon. The father pulls the anchor off the moon and it plunks back into the sea. \n\nThe three of them look at each other and lay hands on each other's backs, satisfied. They all look up at the sky, where the moon is now just a golden sliver of stars, the rest of its surface, cleared, blending into the night sky.\n\nThe words \"La Luna\" appear in blue across the screen.\n\nNow, against a much more sketchy and animated background of the stars, the moon, and the boy, the credits appear, and the screen goes to black.\n\n\n",

He reaches the top and starts floating off onto the moon which is filled with a bunch of golden stars.\n\nHe is amused. \n\nThe boys hooks the hook onto the moon and the men come up to join him.\n\nA new shooting star appears onto the moon as the boy touches it it glows.\n\nHe runs to his dad who opens a door to pull out cleaning tools.\n\nThe father shows the boy how to broom, and the grandfather shows him how to mop\n\nThey are arguing.\n\nThe moon shakes, they are frightened and hide under stars, looking up to see  the biggest shooting start land on the moon.\n\nThey try to pull out the star as the boy gets an idea after touching it and it glowing\n\nhe runs to the tool box to grab a hammer\n\nclimbing up to the star the taps the star and it shatters into tiny little pieces\n\nThey star amazed as the boy falls down with the stars\n\nHe giggles with them\n\nThey collectively begin to rake the stars\n\nThey come back down to the boat and look up at the crescent moon.",

                "notes": "This is an audio description of the Pixar short film, \"La Luna.\" The film uses 3D animation. \nOver a large body of water, bright stars shine in a dark night sky. \nA small wooden boat with the words \"La Luna\" on its side rows smoothly through calm dark water.\nA large middle-aged man rows the boat. A young boy sits in the middle and a small old man sits in the back. \nThe boat is lit up by a small lantern at its back end. \nTogether they sail through the still water. \nThe large man sets the rows down in the boat, as the old man drops an anchor into the water. \nThe old man passes the boy a blue sack and tugs his ear playfully. The boy holds it and looks up at the large man, who permits him to open it. \nHe finds in the sack a brown hat just like the one the other men wear. He looks at them both and puts it on. \nThe old man tilts the hat up on his head. The large man waves his hands disagreeably, and lowers it. \nThe two take turns, raising and lowering the boy\u2019s hat. The large man lowers it again, picks the boy up and plants him by the old man, who give a dismissive wave and switches off the light. \nThe boat sits still on the water. \nBoth men cross their arms and stare at one another. The boy crosses his and looks back and forth between them. \nThe large man wipes his nose. The boy copies him, then looks up as the old man sticks his finger in his ear. The boy does the same. The boat is lit up by gigantic moon that rises over the surface of the water. \nThe boy stares in awe. \nThe moon towers over the small boat. \nThe large man hands the boy a heavy anchor so heavy the boy can barely lift it. \nHe leans to throw the anchor into the water, but the old man waves \"no\" with his finger.\nThe large man pulls an endless ladder from the boat\u2019s bottom, props it in place, and reaches his hand out to the boy. \nThe older man waves the boy on encouragingly. \nThe boy looks at them both and wraps the anchor around his back. He begins to climb the ladder, then hesitates and looks down at the men. \nHe goes up further. Up and up and up, with the anchor\u2019s rope dangling below him.\nFinally, he reaches the ladder\u2019s end, which stops just out of reach of the moon. \nScared and surprised, he begins to float.  Nearly losing his hat, he grips it tightly. \nHe struggles to swim through the air, and is pulled in hard to the moon\u2019s surface. It\u2019s covered in a million large, glowing stars. \nAfter landing on the moon upside down, his world is turned around and the moon becomes the floor. The entire surface of the moon glows yellow with stars.\nHe smiles in amazement. \nStars cover every spot of the moon and fill its deep craters. \nThe boy looks up to see the men above him and the long, tall ladder hanging down. \nThe large man waves down to him and begins to wind the anchor\u2019s rope. \nThe anchor starts to float up. The boy grabs it quickly and attaches it to a crater. \nThe men climb up the ladder from the water below, as the boy watches them approach the moon from above him.  \nSuddenly, a star surrounded by a glowing blue cloud falls from the sky and hits the moon, knocking other stars out of place on the surface. \nThe cloud disappears and the boy runs to it. \nHe kneels down and taps it with his finger. A wave of gold light rolls over it. \nHe reaches to pick it up, then pulls back. He runs to meet the others. \nThe men walk casually through the surface stars, pushing them with their steps. \nThe large man opens a door to a small shack, and pulls out a cart of brooms. \nThe older man sweeps the stars on the floor with a broom of straw. The large man grabs a push broom.\nThe boy eagerly looks for a tool. \nInstead, he follows the large man empty-handed. \nThe large man pushes the broom forward, twirls it in the air, and gives it to the boy.\nThe old man waves his finger disapprovingly, dusts the stars with the straw broom, and gives his broom to the boy. \nNow, he holds both brooms. \nThe boy places the yellow straw in front of the old man\u2019s white beard and smiles.\nHe then holds the thick, rectangular push broom up to the large man\u2019s thick mustache. \nHe frowns.\nThe stars on the floor begin to shake, as a bright blue glowing star falls from the sky.  \nThe three dive into a crater and the star crashes into the surface. \nThe boy\u2019s head peaks out from the crater first, followed by the others\u2019. \nA giant star stands tall on the moon, with a single point lodged below the surface.\nThe men are in awe. \nThe ground around the giant star is wiped clean. \nA shovel lies in pieces. The old man wedges his straw broom below the star, as the large man pushes it. \nThe men wave their arms at each other in disagreement. \nThe boy stares intently at the star, and gently touches it. \nHe pulls back and hits it, sending a great gold wave rolling over the immense star. \nHis eyes widen, and he runs and pulls something from the cart. \nHe turns his brown hat backward and furrows his brow. \nThe men turn from each other and watch as the boy climbs to the star\u2019s highest point. \nHe straddles the star\u2019s point, rubs its surface and listens. \nHe smiles, aligns a hammer to the point, and strikes. \nA flash of white engulfs the sky, and enormous star shatters into thousands of smaller, gold stars. \nThe boy falls gracefully to the floor as a thousand glowing stars fall around him. \nThe younger man removes his hat as both men stare in awe. \nThe boy and the stars fall into a pile. He pops his head out and smiles. \nThe boy pulls the stars toward him with a rake, as the men push and dust them away with their brooms. \nThe boy smiles. \nTogether, the three uncover the dark surface of the moon. \nIn the boat, the large man yanks the rope, releasing the anchor back to the water. \nHe pulls it into the boat. \nThe old man pats the boy\u2019s back. The large man pats his head.\nThe two look at each other, and then up at the sky.  \nThe small boat sits engulfed by the yellow light from a new crescent moon. \nThe sky reads \u201cLa Luna\u201d\nBeside the credits is a hand-drawn illustration of the boy on a small star covered moon. \nChanging positions around the small moon, he searches the sky with a telescope.\n",
