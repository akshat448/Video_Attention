Since it is no longer the norm for movies to display captions, people who are deaf must use an assistive device such as glasses or a device called a CaptiView which sits in a cup holder and displays subtitles.\r\n\r\nThe problem with these devices however is that they can make the user feel like an outcast. DiMarco says, \"The whole experience is annoying, embarrassing. It takes a toll on my deaf identity. It feels like I'm being robbed of my dignity. And it's very destructive to my own identity.\"\r\n\r\nDiMarco calls for movies to display open captions more frequently, saying, \"Open captions are not for the 466 million deaf people alone, they're beneficial for people who have ADHD, people who are autistic, people who have learning disabilities, and even people who want to learn a new language.\"\r\n\r\nConnect with NowThis\r\n\u00bb Like us on Facebook: http://go.nowth.is/News_Facebook\r\n\u00bb Tweet us on Twitter: http://go.nowth.is/News_Twitter\r\n\u00bb Follow us on Instagram: http://go.nowth.is/News_Instagram\r\n\u00bb Find us on Snapchat Discover: http://go.nowth.is/News_Snapchat\r\n\r\nNowThis is your premier news outlet providing you with all the videos you need to stay up to date on all the latest in trending news.
