        "description": "I have known Joe Gordon-Levitt for going on 12 years.  We first met in the summer of 2000 while doing a tiny movie called Manic, where we bonded over a mutual appreciation for Harry Nilsson and Nina Simone and I have been lucky enough to call him one of my dearest friends ever since.  When we did 500 Days of Summer  8 years later, we spent every lunch hour dancing to Marvin Gaye in the hair and make up trailer; we had loads of fun. I hope to do a thousand more movies with him because he's simply the best. But in the meantime, we made a little New Year's duet for all of you! The original by Nancy Wilson. ENJOY! \r\nDon't forget to check out Joe's website http://hitrecord.org/\r\nNew Girl is back January 17 (my birthday) !",
