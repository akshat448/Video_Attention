Along with these words, there is a paper crane and a series of dog footprints on the screen.\n\n0:15 E - Currently on screen is a picture of what would be the completed product of an origami paper boat.\n\n0:20 E - There is a piece of rectangular purple construction paper on a desk. Fold it in half, creasing the long side.\n\n0:53 E - After creasing the folds well, fold it in half once again, creasing the long side. Then, unfold the crease that you just created.\n\n1:11 E - The crease that you unfolded is now a line on the paper that helps guide your folding. Fold one corner of the paper that is not open down to the center line, creating a triangle. Do the same for the other corner that is not open.\n\n1:32 E - The paper should look like a triangle with a rectangle on the bottom. The top part of the rectangle can be folded over onto the triangle, so fold that over. Flip the origami and fold the other side to the same degree that you folded the first. The paper looks as if it is a hat now.\n\n1:53 E - The protruding edges of the current paper can be folded in to create a large triangle. Simply fold the excess parts into the paper.\n\n2:00 E - Open up the triangle and fold it down, creating a square.\n\n2:20 E - There is an open flap on the square that you have now. Fold up the flap to meet the edges of the square, and flip. Then, fold up the other flap to meet the edges of the square again, creating a triangle.\n\n2:35 E - Open up the triangle, then fold it back down to create a square.\n\n2:50 E - Now, you can grab the two sides of the square and pull them back, creating the boat!\n\n3:17 E - Origami step by step, Thank you for your like! As a note from me, the video describer, I apologize for any difficulties while watching this video. It is challenging to describe the process of origami in words, but I hope my description helped somewhat!",
