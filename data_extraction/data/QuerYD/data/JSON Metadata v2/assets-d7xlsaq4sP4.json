        "description": "One of my favourite parts from one of my all time favourite movies. The movie Jack is about a 10 year old boy who is in the 5th grade but has a disease that causes him to age rapidly as he is age 10 he looks like a 40 year old man. He starts out being locked away in his home by his parents since they are very protective of Jack and they are scared to let him outside into the real world cause of how different he is but soon later he starts attending school and meets a group of friends. This is such a sad and powerful movie one that I could watch over and over again if I get enough likes and comments I will happily post up the full movie enjoy!",
