Then, they put a large sheet of paper down on the ground. Afterwards, the children run to the sheet and start painting. A girl has a 1 and 6 painted on her hands.\r\n\r\nIn fast motion, the children use various colors to paint the mural. Then, a closeup of the paintbrushes dipped in blue, are shown as they rub against the sheet. Afterwards, a boy runs up and and smears his blue and black painted hands on the glass. Then, a blond haired girl shows a 1 and 6 painted on her bare feet with purple and yellow dots on her toes as she wiggles her toes slightly. The camera zooms in on her feet. \r\n\r\nThe children continue painting the mural in fast motion. Then, a boy and girl, covered in paint, goof around. A girl smears her green and brown painted hands on the glass. Then, the blond haired girl's feet are shown in closeup with the 1 and 6 painted on each foot.\r\n\r\nThe children finish up painting the mural. Then, they goof around smearing eachother with paint. A girl puts her green painted hand on the glass where the other hands were smeared. Then, the girl shows the 1 and 6 painted on her hands.\r\n\r\nFinally, the children show off their completed painting.",
