        "description": "https://www.expedia.com/Cape-Town.d6046820.Destination-Travel-Guides\r\n\r\nCape Town sits on South Africa\u2019s Cape Peninsula, where the waters of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans converge.\r\n  \r\nBegin your adventure at The Castle of Good Hope, the centerpoint from which the city grew. Nearby you\u2019ll find Company\u2019s Garden, the Parliament Building, and the South African Museum.\r\n \r\nDon\u2019t miss the District Six Museum, which gives voice to the 60,000 non-white residents who saw their vibrant multi-racial neighborhood flattened during the darkest days of the Apartheid era.\r\n \r\nOne neighborhood that was spared from apartheid\u2019s wrecking ball is Bo-Kaap, where traditional Cape Malay culture continues amid the row houses of this colorful hillside suburb.\r\n  \r\nVisit the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront, and explore attractions such as Two Oceans Aquarium. The waterfront is also the gateway to one of the world\u2019s most infamous prisons, Robben Island.\r\n \r\nTable Mountain is Cape Town\u2019s most beloved landmark. From the Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens, take a walking trail up the mountain, or take the Cableway for the spectacular ride to the viewing area.\r\n \r\nCape Town is one of the world\u2019s great beach cities. From Green Point, the site of Cape Town\u2019s futuristic stadium, follow the coast and discover one incredible beach after another.\r\n \r\nCape Town\u2019s riches don\u2019t end with its beaches, it\u2019s also blessed with some of the best wine country in the world. After touring the acclaimed wineries of Paarl and Stellenbosch, head up Franschhoek Pass and wander hillsides filled with Proteas.\r\n \r\nIn local tradition, the Protea represents transformation, courage and hope. Cape Town is a city which shares the same soil, so it\u2019s not surprising that it embodies those same qualities too.",
