                "notes": "A young woman stands in a cartoon-like room holding a small bag, like a small potato-chip bag, which we assume contains rat food.\n\nEven though the room is real (not animated), there are colorful 3D-like cardboard designs on the walls behind her: such as a fireplace, a desk, and a bookshelf. Next to her is a short divider wall that she's using as a table.\n\nOn this table, there is an average-sized black and white rat. Throughout the entire video, the woman gives food to the rat from her bag. The rat seems tamed and content as it scurries about near her on the table.",
