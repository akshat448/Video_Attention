        "description": "A Pusheen's Valentine story - Pusheen spends her Valentine's Day in a special way! Surprises await the internet's most lovable cartoon cat.\n\nI've always wanted to do a Pusheen video and a Valentine's Day video. So why not a Pusheen Valentine's day video? It's quite surprising to me that after almost a decade of being one of the most popular social media icon on the internet Pusheen still hasn't got its own animated series or some kind of animated short like Hello Kitty. Although I like Pusheen (because I think it's cute), I'm not a super crazy Pusheen fan. But I think it would be a great thing if there was a legit Pusheen animated short or whatnot.\n\nAlso, don't feed your cats chocolate. It is poisonous to them. This is just a show.\n\nAnymeow, enjoy! ;) Happy Valentine's Day\n\n#PusheensValentine\n#pusheen\n#valentinesday",
