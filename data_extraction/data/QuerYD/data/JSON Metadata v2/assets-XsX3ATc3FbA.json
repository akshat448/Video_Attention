                "notes": "The video opens with the company's logo: BigHit - Music and Artist for Healing.\n\nIt is evening. Halsey is working in a ticket booth, sucking on a lollipop looking bored. She checks the time and closes the booth.\n\nCut to daytime. BTS are lined with their backs to the camera in front of a movie theater, wearing pink suits. The theater's sign reads \"Persona\". They start dancing, Taehyung looks behind his back at the camera and smirks.\n\nThe boys disperse to give way to Jimin, who dances, poses and flirts with the camera. He is joined by j-hope and Jungkook, each executing the moves with his personal flair.\n\nCut to Taehyung dancing in front of a blue background that matches his striking blue hair. He is wearing a big ring shaped like a pink rose. He is joined by the members to form a line, while Jin goes forward singing at the camera.\n\nOn a new set Jungkook, Jimin and j-hope are dancing in bright denim clothes. The walls behind them move to reveal a retro diner, its windows looking out to a blue sky. They are joined by the other members to dance to the song's prechorus, interspersed with shots of the group goofing around at one of the tables.\n\nBTS run out of the diner to find themselves at the side of the theater. On top of the building, the letters L-O-V-E spring up and from behind them a yellow sofa is launched in the air, landing before the boys. They run and jump on it.\n\nCut to Yoongi against a black set, smiling at the camera and dancing atop a huge piano keyboard that lights up under his feet.\n\nLed by j-hope, BTS are dancing inside a lit room. On the walls there are posters for the movie Singing in the Rain. They run out of the room. In the background we see the movie theater against a sky made up of pink and blue oil paint strokes.\n\nTransition to the boys in white suits against a painted night cityscape. With a snap of his fingers Taehyung lights up the street lamps. Shots BTS waiting in front of the movie theater in the evening, as Halsey passes them by indifferent, alternate with them dancing and spinning around the lampposts.\n\nWe cut to a montage of the members and Halsey on the coach flying through the streets of a city, whose buildings are flooded in pink and yellow paint, and them dancing together in front of the movie theater.\n\nRM is standing on a stage under a spotlight in a white suit and white fedora hat, as the members are watching from the couch. The set around him lights up, and we see him surrounded by electric theater signs. The one behind him reads \"Love\" and the rest spell the names of BTS' old albums. Jin excitedly throws a rose he is holding in the sky and runs to join RM, the others follow. A crowd gathers around the stage.\n\nBTS on stage and the dancers in the crowd dance together in a number that resembles Broadway Melody from the musical Singing in the Rain. This is interspersed with shots of the members dancing together with Halsey in front of the movie theater.\n\nThe scene cuts from BTS dressed in lavish stage clothes, looking serious, to them hugging and shouting in front of the movie theater. In the closing shots they are on stage with their backs to the camera, mimicking the ending of the Boy in Luv choreography. Jungkook's raised hand changes from resembling a pointed gun to making a love sign.",
