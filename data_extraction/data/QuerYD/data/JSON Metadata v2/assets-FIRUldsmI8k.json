                "notes": "The advancing technology (\"the video pans over an image with illustrations of the television's evolution to illustrate the development of technology\") in our modern world becomes increasingly relevant to various sectors of our daily lives as its capabilities grow across the globe (\"an image shows the globalisation of technology\"). For example, the transition towards interactive online learning in the education system provides students and teachers with the potential for greater opportunities. Despite the numerous advantages of utilising technology, the barriers that remain may hinder the growth of individuals who have varied needs. It is important to promote inclusivity in classrooms, but simply implementing accessibility features is inadequate (\"footage of a ted talk by Anthony Jack is inserted\").\n\nSince technology continues to evolve, its possible applications around the world expand with globalisation. This allows individuals and organisations to integrate it into their respective programs. An understanding of inclusivity and basic rights should be established at a young age, and further enforced in workplace discussions. Technology can be effectively incorporated into school curriculums to provide greater opportunities, however, it can also have devastating implications, ultimately reversing the progress of education. Therefore, schools need to advocate inclusivity by embracing diversity, removing barriers and supporting peers, which begins with accessibility for all students. \n\nThe endless potential of technology includes a more comfortable environment (by alleviating anxiety, pressure and stress), a shift in learning and teaching (with a combination of interactive components that provide variety and lead to better engagement) \"EXAMPLES OF THESE BENEFITS ARE SHOWN ON SCREEN, WHICH INCLUDE KAHOOT, ED, EDMODO, PIAZZA\", increased engagement (and thus skills and abilities), greater interaction outside of classrooms (which maximises learning, involvement, discussion, collaboration and feedback opportunities), more resources readily available (including activities, books, discussion forums, maps, podcasts, videos and other published work), and efficient methods of tracking progress (by using online tools).\n\nNevertheless, the inevitable barriers of introducing new elements to teaching and learning must be overcome to maximise the benefits of technology. These drawbacks may lead to the absence of inclusivity \"AN EXAMPLE OF NO INTERNET ACCESS IS SHOWN\" in the lack of access (causing a digital divide between socio-economic classes, where the privileged are provided with better opportunities), limited training and knowledge (due to context, lack of funding and time and different levels of computer literacy), resistance (in attitudes of students and teachers as a response to change), and restricted accommodation (for a population of all ages, context, and abilities). In turn, improper application can inhibit the full potential of technology such that it may be used in place of teaching (where the reduced contact is insufficient to replace the interpersonal interactions that occur), cause disruptions \"THE VIDEO SHOWS FOOTAGE OF A BORED STUDENT LEANING ON HER HAND\" (where students may become distracted and unmotivated by their lack of social and computer skills), lead to exclusion beyond physical interactions (involving bullying, discrimination, stereotypes and stigmas), and increase the likelihood of misconduct (such as cheating and plagiarism \"WHICH IS DEMONSTRATED BY AN EXAMPLE OF HIGHLY PLAGIARISED WORK IN TURNITIN\"). \n\nThus, curriculums should address these issues and consider resolutions that will promote inclusivity, ultimately enhancing teaching and learning \"A FLOW CHART OF STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE INCLUSIVITY IS DRAWN USING THE FOLLOWING IDEAS\". For instance, informing the community of the present issues and discussing role models (who have made a positive impact, to raise awareness and embrace diversity), providing training and lessons (to demonstrate efficient use of technology resources), reviewing the best methods regarding the integration of technology and working towards catering for everyone (by acknowledging all kinds of distinct disabilities and sharing appropriate responses to various situations \"WHICH HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE DISABILITY STANDARDS FOR EDUCATION 2005 DOCUMENT BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WHICH PROVIDES PRACTICE EXEMPLARS\") are several strategies that can be used to overcome barriers and create an inclusive environment using technology in classrooms.\n\nBy analysing the potential impacts of technology, we can compare traditional and modern styles of teaching and learning \"COMPARISONS ARE MADE USING IMAGES OF OLD CLASSROOMS WITH CHALKBOARDS AND NEWER CLASSROOMS SMART-BOARDS AND TECHNOLOGY\". The barriers that students and teachers encounter when using technology for educational purposes illustrates the importance of raising awareness in the advocation of inclusivity. \"ANOTHER CLIP FROM ANTHONY JACK'S TED TALK IS INSERTED\"",
