        "description": "The Fermentation Science and Technology major blends a strong interdisciplinary science background with selected courses focused on the science, safety, culinary, and nutritional attributes of fermented foods and beverages. Understanding the processes and learning the method involved with employing microorganisms in the commercial production of fermented food products requires a unique set of knowledge and skills.\n\nThis major prepares students for employment in divisions within the food and beverage industry including product development, processing, quality assurance and control, packaging and distribution, and plant management. Students enrolled in this major are encouraged to participate in industry activities to increase their understanding of processing methods and specific techniques used in all aspects of fermented food and beverage production.\n\nLearn more about a B.S. in Fermentation Science and Technology: http://www.fshn.chhs.colostate.edu/students/undergraduate/fermentation-science/program-overview.aspx",
