                "notes": "The scene comes from the film, I Am Sam. The film is about a single-parent father with a developmental disability of Autism who has to fight for the custody of his seven-year-old daughter in the court to prove that he has the mental capacity to take care and provide for his daughter. The scene begins with him sitting inside the witness box after arriving late for his hearing drenched in coffee he spilled on himself at his Starbucks job. \n\nThe scene opens by having the camera capture Sam from the left side of this body, where he finds himself glancing up as he gathers his words and resonds to why he believes he is a good parent. \n\nThe camera switches frontward, never still but rather in constant movement,  we are able to see Sam struggling to put his thoughts together. (24:50) Instantly the screen showcases a previous scene of the movie in which Sam and his daughter Lucy both are displayed smiling as they are swinging on a swing at the park. \n\nThe camera returns to Sam's face. \n\n(34:00) The camera turns to Rita Harrison, the lawyer who at the beginning only accepted to represent him to show off to her co workers that the the work she was doing was pro bono; however, by this scene their relationship had become a friendship and her facial expression depicted the admiration she felt for him.\n\n(38:00) The camera switches to Mr. Turner, the prosecutor in favor of having Lucy placed in a foster home.   \n\n\n(44:00) The camera turns to Rita's facial expression of confusion.  Where she side eyes the judge. \n\n(48:00) The camera returns to Sam as he continues to speak looking off-camera, with sadness and hurt shown through his eyes. \n\n(58:00) The camera turns to the judge where he looks at Sam and then eyes Rita. Turning back looking at Rita, Mr. Turner shares the same expressions of confusion. the camera shows Rita moving her mouth as if she wants to say something. \n\n1:06: \nSam  is squinting, moving forwards and backwards, looking towards the ceiling as he struggles to pronounce a word. \nThe camera shows Rita puzzled as to what Sam is trying to say. Sam continues to struggle. \n\n\n1:23: One of Sam's friend sitting in the opposite side of the courtroom stands and says the word he meant all along. The camera turns from Sam's  friend, to Rita, to Mr.Turner and back to the friend who is still standing as he speaks. The camera movement repeats. \n\n\n1:42: Camera shows Sam turn his head  to look both sides as the Mr. Turner and Rita speak. \n\nTrying to face everyone talking at once, Sam looks at his friend, Mr. Turner and Rita as she speaks to the judge. \n\n\n1:54: Camera shows Rita dissapointed after being denied her plee and sits back down. \nThe camera returns to Sam. Who speaks looking off-camera. \n\n2:25: The camera turns to Mr. Turner and zooms in as he continues to question Sam. Confused Sam remains silent and at point of tears as he tries to understand everything occuring. Rita interrupts the Mr. Turner's interrogation after seeing Sam's frustration as he's bombarded with questions from Mr. Turner. \n\n2:34: The camera turns to Sam who raises a finger to make clear his statment as he addresses Mr.Turner.\n\n2:44 Camera quickly moves from Mr. Turner to Rita, to the judge and back to Sam as the interrogation heightens everyone's feelings. \n\n2:50: In tears and through the constant movement of his fingers, Sam looks down as he internalizes the words Mr.Turner cold-heartedly expresses. \n\n3:03 Camera turns to Rita standing. The judge looks away. \n\n\n3:23-3:35 in: Capturing Sam from all angles, the rear, the sides, and the front, Sam's frustrations and tears are depicted through his physicality and tone. \n\n3:35: The camera turns to Rita, whose eyes are watery as she watches Sam tormented by the situation he is being put on. \n\n3:38 in: Mr. Turner looks down and then turns to Sam whose banging on the podium with both hands. \n\n3:40in: we see Sam upclose from his left side where he continues to  bang then the camera widens to showcase the entire courtroom, through the movement of the camera and the final shot of the entire courtroom, the feelings of anger, pain, and sarrow Sam is experiencing are transered to the audience. \n\nThe scene ends.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
