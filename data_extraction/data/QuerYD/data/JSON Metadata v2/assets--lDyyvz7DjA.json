        "description": "To celebrate the arrival of ET-94 in 2016, the California Science Center conducted in-person interviews with 10 NASA space shuttle astronauts inside the flight deck and middeck of Endeavour. In these interviews, the astronauts talked about their participation in the space shuttle program focusing on their specialties, training and mission role. Topics covered include their experiences in a microgravity environment, working in space, as well as their observations and insights into human space exploration.\n\nThese individual interviews were used to create a series of five thematic videos to be featured in the future Shuttle Gallery of the Samuel Oschin Air and Space Center.\n\nWe\u2019re pleased to share these instructive and inspirational never-before-seen videos with you. This video, Becoming an Astronaut, is the first in the series.\n\nThis video series was made possible by a generous grant from The Ahmanson Foundation.",
