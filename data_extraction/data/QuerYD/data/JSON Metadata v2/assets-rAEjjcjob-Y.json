                "notes": "There is a Physical Therapist Assistant wearing a yellow hospital gown, blue gloves & a face mask is standing next to an elderly woman named Phyllis.  Phyllis is lying in a hospital bed.  She is weak and on a ventilator & has several hospital lines attached to her. The PTA is bending her legs and lifting her arms to test her mobility.   Phyllis does her best lifting her legs and arms.\n1:10 \nIn the same hospital room, Phyllis is doing leg strengthening exercises on a treatment table.  The PTA is standing next to the table helping her lift her legs.  \n1:39\nThe scene changes to another PTA helping Phyllis lift her right arm.  The elderly woman is upright on the treatment table and is still weak.  She is still on the ventilator.\n1:49 \nIn her hospital room, Phyllis is sitting on the edge of her bed.  She grips onto two handles on a platform of an assistive device that lifts her to a standing position. She appears to be a little stronger and is not on the ventilator. Phyllis is also nervous to take a step. There are 2 PTA\u2019s in the hospital room.  One is standing next to her and the other is controlling the assistive device.  She takes a few steps and gets tired.  The PTA helps her sit into a wheelchair.\n2:27\nPhyllis in a wheelchair.  She has a mask on. The PTA transfers her from the wheelchair to a treatment table.  He has his arms around her waist and assists her to the table.  She is lying on the table doing leg strengthening exercises.  She is stronger.  She pushes herself up and down with her legs.\n3:24\nPhyllis is standing up in the hospital hallway with both hands gripped around two handles of the assistive device.  2 PTA\u2019s are beside her as she takes several steps. She is happy.\n3:40 \nThe elderly woman is sitting in her wheelchair pushing herself backwards with her legs down a long hallway.\n3:49\nThe elderly woman is in a wheelchair between the parallel bars.  She stands and takes several steps holding the parallel bars.  Her legs are stiff and she wobbles.  One PTA is standing beside her and the other PTA is behind her wheelchair. \n4:42\nThe elderly woman is sitting in her wheelchair.  She is using stationary bike petals to help strengthen her legs.\n4:46\nThe elderly woman is sitting in her wheelchair playing a boxing video game that allows her arm motions to be used as the game controller.  She laughs as she wins the game.\n5:09\nIn the hospital hallway, the elderly woman is sitting in her wheelchair.  The PTA helps her stand and walk. She uses a walker to take steps down the hallway.  She smiles as she walks.  \n\n6:02\nThe elderly woman continues walking with the help of her walker. The PTA is holding her by her waist with a gait belt.  She is stronger and her legs move faster as she takes steps.  She is happy.  The scene quickly changes to her as she sits in her wheelchair and she raises her arms celebrating her accomplishment. \n6:36\nThe elderly woman is walking down the hallway with no assistance.  She is dressed in a nice colorful shirt with black pants with her husband walking beside her.  She claps her hands.  She is very happy.  She thanks the therapists for all their help.\n7:21\nThe video ends with 2 picture of Phyllis' journey to recovery.  The 1st picture show her laying in her hospital bed weak and had no motion.  The 2nd shows her walking down the hallway by herself.\n",
