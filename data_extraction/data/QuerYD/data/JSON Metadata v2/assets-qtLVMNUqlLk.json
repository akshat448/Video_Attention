The ocean spreads out behind them, sweeping past a large log boom in the harbor towards the lighted apartment buildings of a city. Snow-capped mountains form the background in the distance, framed by low-hanging clouds.\n0:29. The background fades to a light blue.\n\nMetadata\n3:11, travels through the distribution chain. A tall stack of books falls over, and one book is selected from the pile.\n3:35, series of tags read by the user's reading system. Kaden is reading a book on an iPad, and Danny is swiping through text on the screen of a tablet. They are seated next to each other at a public library.\n3:40, decide which one they want to read. Kaden selects a title from the Bookshelf app on his iPad.\n4:05, editor of choice. Danny types at the keyboard of a Mac computer.\n\nLinks\n1:30, and that includes links. abc.com changes from black to blue text, then is underlined to indicate it is an active link.\n\nNotes\n2:34, train of thought. An animated train rolls down a track, coming to an abrupt halt when it encounters a large star.\n4:16, presented in a list. Kaden swipes through endnotes from a book entitled \"This Language: A River\" on his iPad.\n\nPage Numbers\n1:20, Page numbers are meaningless. Seated at the library, Kaden is reading a printed book, and Danny is reading on a tablet.\n1:58, in a book club. In a circle, four books flip to page 25 next to a tablet.\n3:32, page number that it represents. text appears: role=doc-pagebreak aria-label=100\n4:00, 55 wave. Plying an ocean of gentle waves, an animated boat abruptly runs over the number 55, then returns to a placid sea.\n",
