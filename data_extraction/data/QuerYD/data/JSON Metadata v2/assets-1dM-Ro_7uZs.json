        "description": "Brown Bag Films' latest short film, 'An Ode To Love', written and directed by Matthew Darragh and produced by Suzie Belton & Danielle Considine with music by Stefan French, tells the story of a man on a desert island who falls in love with a stick....\n\nAn Ode To Love was made with the generous support of Filmbase and RTE, who together with IMRO also gave us the wonderful opportunity to collaborate with the RTE Concert Orchestra for the films score.\n\nAn Ode To Love made its premiere at the 2014 Foyle Film Festival where it received the award for Best Irish Animation and it has since been screened in festivals around the world! Garnering an IFTA nomination for Best Animation, the Best Animation award at the Chicago Reel Shorts Film Festival and Best Animated Film at Rome International Film Festival along the way!\n\n\nhttps://www.brownbagfilms.com/work/an-ode-to-love",
