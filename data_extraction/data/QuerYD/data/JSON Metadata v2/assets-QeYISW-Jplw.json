                "notes": "Three figures make their way onto the dark stage; the director, the actress, and the man.\n \nThe director, a bald, ivory skinned man in a dark suit quickly looks through a roll of film.\n \nOn the opposite corner, the dark haired man dressed in a white suit wraps the actress in a white feather robe to match the ropes of pearls hanging around her neck. \n\nHe guides her up the spiral staircase behind them.\n \nThe director notices and jumps across the stage. He holds her pleadingly but she resists. He takes the white feather coat hastily. Leaving her in a black shimmering gown. He points at the actress to leave. \n \nHe points again, and she looks at him baffled. The actress looks back at the man and makes her way up the stairs. \n \nThe director, looks away in visible distress. He looks back up and angrily points twice more at the pair still standing atop the staircase. The actress and the man disappear and exit the stage. \n \nThe director stands alone in the dark space his hand still pointing.\n \nA title reads \u201cthe director, having removed his beloved woman in an excess of jealousy, remains alone and without a diva.\u201d\n \nHe presses his face to the white feather coat and holds it tightly, he looks out into the crowd with evident sadness in his eyes. \n \nA figure is seen entering the stage behind him. From the left, the director\u2019s assistant approaches the director and he too touches the feather robe.\n \nThe figure is revealed; a bent over woman is seen on the other side of the stage. She sensually makes herself visible displaying a pearly complexion and two dark eyes to match her black hair and lips \n \nThe director looks her down and up and she smiles.\n \nA title reads \u201cexcuse me, are you the director?\u201d\n \nThe director brings his hands to his face in the shape of a camera in agreeance. He looks around and makes his way to his chair. His assistant hands him his megaphone from behind.\n \nThe young actress with both hands clasping her chest awaits her direction\n \nThe director yells through his megaphone making a gestured command\n \nThe woman slowly faces the audience. She suddenly begins to wail soundlessly, pleading to the crowd with both hands in a fist, she throws her head back covering her face in despair. She then drops her hands and head, smiling at the director and concluding her performance.\n \nThe director gestures towards his chest and his face contorts into a second and more hasty demand.\n \nThe young actress  with both hands still on her chest readies herself, she turns to face the audience her mouth widens into a bright beam, she blows kisses into the crowd and wears a humbled expression as she wraps her arms around herself. She drops her smile and arms and concludes her second performance. \n \nThe director points to the young actress, his chest, and back to the young actress.\n \nHe puts his megaphone to his mouth and a title flashes exclaiming the word tears.\n \nThe young actress looks back out into the audience, visibly displeased. Her face contorts into a second even more disconsolate wail, with both hands in a fist she pleads before she throws her head back in desperation. \n \nShe drops the act looking proud and once again smiling to the director. The director looks behind him, and commands her once again. \n \nA title flashes and exclaims tears!\n \nThe young actress, places both hands on her chest, she flinches once\u2026 twice\u2026  she throws herself on the ground with her face between her hands and looks up at the director\n \nHe looks back at her with a face of disgust \n \nHe looks behind him and then proceeds to stand up, \n\nhe begins to yell through the megaphone to the audience\n\nThe young actress, looks up at him frightened. \n \nA title flashes \u201ctears, tears! If you have any respect for me at all you will give me your tears!\n \nThe young actress looks distraught. She reaches over to grab the megaphone. The director places one side to his ear as the actress softly speaks into the other.  \n \nA title flashes \u201cPlease, let me play \u2018Come Back, My Little One\u2019\"\n \nThe director slowly puts the megaphone down looking interested.\n \nHe puts the megaphone back to his mouth and mumbles something\n \nThe young actress, still sitting, readies herself, the director is crouched beside her \n \nHey both stay still looking out into the distance\n\nThe actress looks nostalgic, even melancholic \n\nSo does the director \n \nThe director puts his arm around the young actress, and she cries with both hands still holding her chest\n \nThe director\u2019s assistant is seen crying in the back.\n \nA wide shot of the stage reveals the three characters are joined by two couples standing on each side of the stage looking in. The director hands the young actress a handkerchief and yells out into the megaphone\n \nA title flashes and exclaims \u201cso strong and so sad!\u201d\n",
