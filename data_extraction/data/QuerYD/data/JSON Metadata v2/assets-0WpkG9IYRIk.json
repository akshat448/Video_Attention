        "description": "Basic literacy can be too trivial a matter to you and me but for many it is still a dream. For the visually impaired, Braille literacy stands as an unattainable reverie.There is an urgent need to educate and empower, to reach out, and to generate awareness regarding the value of the embossed word, the beauty of the language, and the magic of the Braille script.\n\nWhite Print, India's first lifestyle magazine in Braille, has therefore initiated a drive to promote Braille literacy and help it spread to the smallest of Indian towns.It is poised to become the Braille anthem of India. Because it is time we have one.\n\nCast\nApurva Mahajan\nSariika Singh\nMahesh Balraj\n \nMusic - Kanishk Seth\nVocals - Upasana Makati & Kanishk Seth\nLyrics: Satyanshu Singh\nIsraj: Arshad Chowdhury\nGuitar: Vinnie Hutton\nMixing & Mastering: Devang Rachh\n\nDirector of Photography: Raaj A Chakravarti\nGaffer: Aqeel\n\nProduction Manager: Shiv Pillai\nThe Boys: Paresh & Kumar\nCasting Support: Jitu Rai\nCostume & AD: Rachit Trehan\n\nEditor: Parikshhit Jha\nProduced By: Upasana Makati & Sharat Kumar\n\nWritten & Directed By: Sharat Kumar\n\nAnimation: Pankaj Ajwani & Huzefa, Concoction\n\nImpossible Without:\nMegha Bissa\nKrutika Behrawala\nPritika Behrawala\nApekshita Varshney\nNational Association for the Blind, Worli",
