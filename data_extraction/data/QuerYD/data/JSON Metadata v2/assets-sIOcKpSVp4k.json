        "description": "Spoiler Alert: You can't. (Please read below, upon further thought I have some very important updates on the involvement of police that I mention in the video)\r\n\r\nSo maybe you've seen someone parking in a disabled parking spot and then walking right into a space or maybe you've seen a wheelchair user move their legs or get up from their chair, maybe you've seen a cane or a walker user take a few steps without it, maybe you've seen younger, prettier, even larger people using power scooters at the market or at theme parks? NONE of those things imply that someone is \"faking\" a disability Disabilities are diverse and fall on spectrums, many disabilities are invisible, and these false accusations of \"faking\" put disabled lives at risk of harassment and violence.\r\n\r\nEDIT: although you technically *could* call law enforcement rather than approach someone yourself, please actually... DON'T. \r\n\r\nhat's actually a dangerous action to take, police are often not well trained in regards to people with disabilities and their possible intersections, and you could endanger someone further by getting the police involved. \r\n\r\nPlease just mind your own business. Invisible disabilities exist no matter, age, race, size, fashion choices, etc. There is no reason to suspect someone of faking the need for their decal.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy my videos, please consider supporting this channel and/or my medical funds:\r\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/annieelainey\r\nPayPal: http://bit.ly/1D7QYW2\r\n\r\nFIND ME ON THE INTERNET AND LET'S BE FRIENDS!\r\nhttp://annieelainey.tumblr.com\r\nhttp://instagram.com/annieelainey\r\nhttp://twitter.com/annieelainey\r\nhttp://facebook.com/annesegarra\r\nSnapchat: annieelainey\r\n\r\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE AND CHECK OUT MORE VIDEOS\r\nhttp://youtube.com/theannieelainey",
