        "description": "As children around the country are sheltering-in-place, some are exposed to potentially traumatic events. These events can undermine children\u2019s sense of safety, stability, and bonding with caregivers.\n\nACEs are common, linked to a large number of health conditions, and costly to families, communities, and society. When children are exposed to ACEs, they are also at higher risk for developing an overactive stress response.\n\nIt is for this reason that the COVID-19 pandemic can be particularly distressing for those with a history of ACEs. The good news is that ACEs are preventable, and the harmful effects of ACEs can be mitigated with intervention.\n\nDr. Nathaniel Riggs, director of the CSU Prevention Research Center, moderated a 45-minute discussion on ACEs during the COVID-19 pandemic with Dr. Sharon A. Hoover, a licensed clinical psychologist and associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nThe CSU Prevention Extension Cast features monthly interviews with nationally recognized experts on current issues in the fields of prevention science and public health. Funding for this project comes from a grant provided by the CSU College of Health and Human Sciences.\n\nWebsite: https://www.chhs.colostate.edu/prc\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/csuhdfs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/csuhdfs/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/csuhdfs",
