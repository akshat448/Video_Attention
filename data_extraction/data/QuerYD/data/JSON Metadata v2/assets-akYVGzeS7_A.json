                "notes": "The cover of an anatomy book is opened. A woman's drawing is shown. Her eyes are open, she looks alive. A hand holding an injector sucks fat from the woman's neck and injects fat into her cheeks. A hand holding forceps takes out an eyeball, then another one, and replaces both of them with bigger ones. A brush colors her eyelashes dark brown. Her short brown hair is changed with longer black hair. An injection makes her lips thicker. Her eyebrows are colored much darker black. Her belly is shown. For a thinner waist, her last rib bones on both sides are broken and taken out. For thinner arms, fat from around her elbows is sucked out. Fat from her hips is sucked out. For longer legs, her shin-bones near her ankles are stretched. She is given a solarium treatment for a darker skin. Eyeliner is applied to make her eyes look significantly darker. After a series of injections, her lips are much fuller, her neck is a lot thinner, and her cheeks are considerably more prominent. Her black hair is turned to blond. Her nose is cut out and replaced with a more upturned nose. Her hair is removed, skull is cut open, and brain is taken out. She rolls her eyes backwards. An injection colors her brain pink, and it is put back into her skull. She smiles. A hand wipes the blood on her forehead. Her blond hair is put back. First her right eyebrow then the left one falls. She is given an extreme dose of solarium treatment. Her hair is burned, skin melted down, and her whole body is damaged.  ",
