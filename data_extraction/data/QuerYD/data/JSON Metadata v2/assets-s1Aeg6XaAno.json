        "description": "When astronauts do science in space, they discover new details about lots of things\u2014how our bodies work in microgravity, what conditions in space are like, and more. But they can also find out more about how lots of things work on Earth too! Find out about experiments with fire, gravity, surface tension and more in this video featuring\u00a0 interviews with astronauts and footage of science experiments in space.\n\nScience in Space is the fifth and final video of our series of themed astronaut videos. They were\u00a0developed to be featured in the future Shuttle gallery of the Samuel Oschin Air and Space Center.\n\nAstronaut interviews and this video series were made possible by a generous grant from The Ahmanson Foundation.\n\nFor more science videos, blog posts, and virtual tours, visit californiasciencecenter.org/beyond",
