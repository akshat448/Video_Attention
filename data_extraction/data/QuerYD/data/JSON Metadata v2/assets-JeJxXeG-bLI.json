                "notes": "three children hold up a book titled Miss Sofie's Story Time.\n\nThe cover of \"Braids\" shows a young girl with a red shirt and curly black hair. Her hair is being pulled by another woman and she has a comb beside her. The girl seems shocked and displeased.\n\nThe first page of the book shows the girl, Ashley, eating at her breakfast table. Her mother is seen with a purple shirt and green pants and she is standing in the doorway. \n\nAshley's mother points at Ashley's messy hair.\n\nThe next page shows Ashley running around her house: behind the chair, across the carpet, and over the couch. Her mother tries to catch her, but is not successful.\n\nAshley now unhappily sits in a chair at a table while her mother pulls her hair and braids it. Next to her mother, there is a brush and a comb. Ashley seems to be mad at her mother and glares at her. Ashley's brown and white dog and orange cat sneak in from the corner.\n\nAshley admires them in front of a mirror in the bathroom. Her hair is tied into a ponytail and braided with white beads. Her mother stands beside her and seems satisfied with her braids. Ashley's dog is also admiring himself in a mirror and her cat is hiding in the bathtub.\n\nThe next page shows Ashley sitting down on the front steps of her house with her head in her hands. She looks sad or mad. Her dog is at her feet and the cat is in the window. \n\nAshley's grandmother comes up and talks with Ashley. She has curly white hair, and silver earrings. She wears a purple headband, purple glasses, purple sandals, and carries a purple bag. She wears a colorful green shirt and plaid yellow pants. \n\nAshley's mouth is wide open and and her eyes are closed. She looks like she is crying and her hands are up in the air. Ashley's grandmother is confused and surprised. The cat and dog also look very confused.\n\nAshley, her grandmother, and her dog are at the entrance of her house. They stand on a red and purple rug. They are happy, smiling, and have their hands up in the air. \n\nAshley's mother was at her table reading and drinking coffee, but now she is surprised and looks like she wants to run away.\n\nAshley's mother is running away from Ashley. Her hands are up in the air and she is yelling.\n\nShe runs behind the chair, across the carpet, and over the couch as Ashley chases her. Ashley's dog is also chasing her.\n\nAshley's mother sits in a chair at a table with her arms crossed in front of her. She looks mad and annoyed. Ashley and Ashley's grandmother are on both sides of Ashley's mother and they pull and tug at her hair happily. \n\nAshley's mother stands in front of a mirror in the bathroom admiring her fancy braids. Her hair is braided into three parts, curly braids in the front, a bun in the middle, and loose braids with white beads. Ashley and her grandmother stand next to her with happy and smug faces. Their arms are crossed in front of them. \n\nAshley's mother sits on the front steps of her house with a happy expression. Ashley stands next to her and points at her teacher on the street. Ashley's teacher has short, curly, blond hair. She wears black glasses, a blue sweater, a black skirt, and brown sandals. Her cat is in the window braiding the dog's hair.\n\nAshley's teacher yells and has her hands up in the air. She runs across the grass, behind the mailbox, and around the crossing guard. \n\nAshley's family and all their neighbors chase Ashley's teacher.\n\nAshley's teacher sits on a mailbox while Ashley's mother and her grandmother braid her hair. Their neighbors watch and point at the sight.\n\nAshley's teacher admires her braids with a pink mirror in her hand. Her hair sticks up in braids around her head like an afro. Ashley and her mother laugh next to her. The neighbors around them seem a little confused, but happy. \n\nAshley's teacher stands in the middle of her classroom reading a book to the class. Her classroom is decorated with animal drawings and alphabet posters. Her students sit in green and brown desks around her. They seemed scared and surprised. Some of her students surround her with shocked faces.",

        "description": "BOOK LINK: https://amzn.to/2rBeWJ6\nMORE KIDS BOOKS: http://amzn.to/2roIH2F\nGREAT TOY DEALS: https://de.banggood.com/custlink/mDvKbkNuZd\n\nWelcome to Miss Sophie\u2019s storytime. Today we\u2019re going to read Braids! By Robert Munsch and illustrated by Dave Whamond.\n\nOn Saturday, when Ashley was sitting at the breakfast table, her mother came in and said, \u201cLook at your hair. It\u2019s a mess! It needs a few braids.\u201d \u201cA few!\u201d yelled Ashley. \u201cYou always put in a million braids and pull on my hair and it hurts and i takes all day! NO! NO! NO! My hair is OK to just go out and play.\nThen Ashley ran around the house screaming \u201cAhhhhh! Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh!\u201d while her mother tried to catch her. After they had gone around the house seventeen times, Ashley\u2019s mother caught her, sat her on a chair and started to braid her hair. It took two hours because Ashley\u2019s mom braided her hair back and forth and back and forth and back and forth, AND up and down and up down and up and down, AND round and round and round and round and round and round. When she was done, Ashley looked in the mirror and said, \u201cOh, look! It\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s wonderful. But it took forever! I wish you didn\u2019t like to braid my hair.\u201d Ashley went outside and sat down on the front steps. People came by and said, \u201cHey Ashley! Nice hair,\u201d and Ashley didn\u2019t say anything. Then Ashley\u2019s grandmother came by. She said, \u201cAshley! What wonderful braids. But why are you so mad?\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s that mother of mine!\u201d said Ashley. \u201cShe likes to braid my hair and it takes all day. Some kids go to the mall, some kids play games, I just get my hair braided.\u201d \u201cDo you know,\u201d said her grandmother, \u201cwhy your mother likes to braid like that?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Ashley. \u201cShe learned it from me,\u201d said her grandmother. \u201cWhen your mom was a little girl I used to braid her hair all the time. It took all day.\u201d \u201cHome come you don\u2019t braid her hair now?\u201d said Ashley. \u201cCan\u2019t catch her,\u201d said her grandmother. \u201cMaybe both of us could catch her!\u201d said Ashley. \u201cGood idea,\u201d said her grandmother. So they went into the house and Ashley\u2019s grandmother said to Ashley\u2019s mother, \u201cLook at your hair. It needs some BRAIDS!\u201d Uh oh, someone doesn\u2019t look like she wants her hair braided. Ashley\u2019s mom spilled her coffee and dropped her book when she heard that. \u201cNO, NO, NO!\u201d yelled Ashley\u2019s mom. \u201cI am grown up now and I have important things to do! NO! NO! NO! NO!\u201d Ashley\u2019s grandmother said, \u201cNow come on, sweet pea, I\u2019m going to braid your hair.\u201d Ashley\u2019s mom ran around the house screaming \u201cAhhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!\u201d while Ashley and her grandmother tried to catch her. They chased Ashley\u2019s mother around the house seventeen times until they finally caught her. Then they sat her in a chair and braided her hair for three hours. Like mother like daughter. But together Ashley and her grandmother finally caught her. I think she ran the same path as Ashley did earlier. It took three hours because they braided her hair back and forth and back and forth and back and forth, AND up and down and up down and up and down, AND round and round and round and round and round and round. When they were done, Ashley\u2019s mother looked in the mirror and said, \u201cOh, look! It\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s wonderful. But it took forever. I wish you didn\u2019t like to braid my hair.\u201d Then Ashley and her mother sat out on the front steps. Ashley\u2019s teacher came by and said, \u201cMy! What lovely braids. I wish I had hair like that.\u201d \u201cLET\u2019S GET HER!\u201d said Ashley. \u201cGet WHO?\u201d said the teacher. \u201cGet YOU!\u201d said Ashley. \u201cWe\u2019re going to braid your hair and it will take all day!\u201d \u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d yelled the teacher. She ran down the street, and Ashley and her mom and her grandmother and all the neighbours ran after her. They chased the teacher around the block seventeen times until Ashley finally caught her. Then they sat her on a mailbox and braided her hair. It took six hours because they braided it back and forth and back and forth and back and forth, AND up and down and up down and up and down, AND round and round and round and round and round and round. When they were done the teacher had a thousand little braids in her hair. She looked sort of like a porcupine.\u201dLooks nice!\u201d said Ashley\u2019s grandmother. \u201cLooks great!\u201d said Ashley\u2019s mother. \u201cWow!\u201d said Ashley\u2019s teacher. \u201cI\u2019m going to wear these braids to school!\u201d And Ashley decided not to tell her teacher that sometimes people just do not look good in braids. #kids #reading #books",
