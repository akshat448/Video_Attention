        "description": "Il Canto degli Italiani (The Song of the Italians) is the Italian national anthem. It is best known among Italians as Inno di Mameli (Mameli's Hymn), after the author of the lyrics, or Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy), from its opening line. The words were written in the autumn of 1847 in Genoa, by the then 20-year-old student and patriot Goffredo Mameli, in a climate of popular struggle for unification and independence of Italy which foreshadowed the war against Austria. Two months later, they were set to music in Turin by another Genoese, Michele Novaro.[1] The hymn enjoyed widespread popularity throughout the period of the Risorgimento and in the following decades.\r\n\r\n I take no credit for the creation of the music or the image used in the video, I just chucked the two together for everyone's enjoyment.",
