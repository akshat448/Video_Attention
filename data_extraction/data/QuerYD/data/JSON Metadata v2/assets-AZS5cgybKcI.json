                "notes": "This is an audio description of the Pixar SparkShort, \u201cKitbull\u201d. The film is traditionally animated, meaning hand drawn. While the backgrounds, like a city street or a yard, look more realistic, the animals in the film are cute and cartoonistic. \n\nCars pass on busy street. \nA cute black kitten runs skittishly, hiding behind signs on a bustling city sidewalk with a fish in his mouth.\nA woman sweeping a storefront kneels to the cat. He runs away from her under a car, and then down a dark alley, passing a fence painted with graffiti.\nThe kitten sneaks through a crack in the fence into a grassy yard, and climbs atop a neighboring fence, where he stares warily as pigeons perch on a wood pile below.\nHe jumps from the fence and scares the birds away.\nThe cat takes the fish in his mouth and crawls into a cardboard box atop the pile, Inside, he snuggles against a purple stuffed elephant and puts down his fish.\nThe cat licks his paw, scratches his ear, and settles onto a pillow inside the box. \nNight time.\nHeadlights illuminate the yard as a car approaches.\nThe kitten stretches, and awakes, alarmed, with one eye wide open. \nThe cat hides under the elephant. \nThe cat looks out from its box as two men set a wooden crate in the yard, while another guides a dog on a chain.\nThe cat hides.\nDay time. \nThe cat peeks out from the box and looks around.\nThe wooden crate is empty.\nThe dog is standing right by the box, drooling. \nThe cat claws at the dog\u2019s large nose and misses.\nThe dog runs away and stares curiously at the cat.\nHe approaches cautiously, but the cat lashes out, his back arched and claws out.\nThe cat runs in place with its eyes lowered and its hair standing up. \nThe dog jumps playfully, wagging his tail. He lowers his body to the ground. \nA man\u2019s foot steps onto the porch. The dog turns toward him and the cat runs back to the box.\nThe dog wags his tail, as the man puts a collar on the dog\u2019s neck, turns and kneels beside the crate. \nWagging his tail, the dog follows the man, as he goes back upstairs and closes the door.  \nThe dog sits at the bottom of the steps with his head lowered. \nHe turns to the cat, who retreats into the box. \nThe dog lays alone beside the crate in the empty yard.\nThe cat peeks out from the box, and begins to crawl down from the garbage pile when a plastic bottle rolls out from under him. \nThe cat scurries to the box, and a bottle cap rolls on the ground below. \nHe comes back out and approaches the cap with caution. \nThe cat taps the cap with his paw and it rolls away. His eyes widen in amusement.\nThe cat chases the cap. \nHe pounces, sending it rolling out of his reach. \nIt hits the dog\u2019s nose. \nThe cat runs  to hide as the dog wakes.\nThe cat\u2019s eyes widen as the cap returns to him. \nThe cat rolls around playfully with the cap in his paws.\nThe dog approaches slowly. The cat stiffens and his hair rises. \nBut a chain holds the dog back. \nWith wide eyes, the cat looks between the cap and the dog. \nThe cap rolls to the barbed wire that separates them.\nThe cat nudges the cap with his paws, sending it back towards the dog. \nThe dog lifts his head in amusement and the cat scurries away. \nQuickly, the cap rolls and hits the cat. The cat jumps, falls back to play with the cap, and jumps again. He leaps toward the cap, plays dead, and nudges the cap again. \nWagging his tail, the dog returns it. \nAn airplane soars in clouds above.\nThe cat runs back to the box. He peeks out. \nThe man holds a blue stuffed bear the the dog, and holds on as the dog tears it away with his teeth.\nThe dog rips off its head. He sits and wags his tail as the man pats his head and goes upstairs.\n\nThrough a hole in the cardboard, the cat\u2019s eyes widen as he retreats to hide near the elephant.\n\nAt night, it is pouring rain.   \nThe man kicks the dog and send him rolling down the stairs. Many bloody cuts cover the dog\u2019s body. \nHe lays on the floor in the rain. \nHe limps up the stairs. The cat watches from the box, as the dog scratches the door.\nThe cat huddles beside the elephant, then jumps up as items fall through the cardboard roof, releasing rain into the box. A piece of wood hits the box, and it hurdles down the pile. \nThe cat leaps in fear, as his head is caught in plastic soda rings. The rings are stuck on the barbed wire. \nThe dog approaches. The cat struggles to run away. \nThe dog moves the wire with his teeth. He bites the plastic rings, letting the cat free.\nThe cat scratches the dog\u2019s nose. The dog backs away with sad eyes. \nLightning flashes over the cat\u2019s crouched body as his eyes widen and he runs up the pile. \nThe cat watches as the dog lowers his head, and limps slowly into his crate.\nThe cat lays on a wood beam in the pile as his wide eyes stare at the dog\u2019s crate.\nEarly morning. The rain has stopped. \nThe cat sits on a toppled garbage can. His paw dangles and he tail wags.\nThe cat jumps down and sits next to the cap on the ground. He taps it gently. It rolls and stops. \nThe cat looks toward the dog in the crate and hits the cap again. It rolls to the crate. The dog is still. \nStaring at the still dog widely, the cat lowers his ears and approaches cautiously.\nThe cat\u2019s paw reaches into the crate. He peeks at the dog, who faces the back wall. \nThe cat enters the crate carefully. The dog stirs. The cat halts.\nThe cat turns to leave, then stops and looks back. \nInstead, he lowers his ears and lays at the dog\u2019s side. The dog\u2019s are opened now. \nThe cat inches closer and licks the dog\u2019s wounds. \nThe dog closes his eyes. \nThe cat rubs its head on the dog\u2019s face and lays down. Both close their eyes. \nThe dog wags his tail, and looks at the cat. He closes his eyes once more. \nThe cat jumps down from the crate and hits the cap with its paws. \nThe dog and cat jump around the cap as it moves. \nThe porch light switches on. \nThe dog cowers with its tail between its legs, the cat runs away. \nThe cat stops to turn toward the dog.\nThe dog turns to follow. \nThe cat runs up an angled plank of wood to the top of the fence and looks down. \nThe dog struggles to follow as the wood breaks. \nThe wood pile begins to fall beneath the dog. \nThe cat runs back down and hurries the dog to move with its paws. The cat jumps on the dog\u2019s head. The dog jumps. His front legs reach the top of the fence. His back legs dangle, but he pulls himself up and over the fence.\nChain in hand, the man walks downstairs to an empty backyard and looks around. \n\nDay time. A bus drives down a busy street.\nIn an alley, the cat wags his tail, pounces playfully and bites the dog\u2019s tail.\nThe pair hop around each other. The cat hops on the dog\u2019s face and the dog rolls over on his back with his tongue out. \nThe cat runs over two garbage cans. A person places an open can of food on the ground. The cat approaches slowly. \nThe woman sits cross-legged and reaches her hand out toward the cat. The cat turns to leave, then turns back toward her. The cat rubs his head on her hand affectionately. She strokes the cat\u2019s head with her thumb.\nThe dog appears from behind a tree with scars on his face. As he approaches, the woman stands up quickly. \nThe cat parades around the dog\u2019s front leg, rubbing his head on his leg. He sits below the dog.\nThe woman moves closer and kneels. She reaches out and pets the dogs head gently, as he looks back at her. \n\nThe cat frolics through a green field. The dog follows wearing an orange bandana. \nThe cat jumps on the dog\u2019s head. Together, they sit with the woman and a man on a hilltop overlooking the city. \n\nOn a vibrantly painted fence, a mural of the cat and dog reads the word \u201cKitbull.\n",
