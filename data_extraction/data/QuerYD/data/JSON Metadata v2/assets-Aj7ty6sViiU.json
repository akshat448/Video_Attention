        "description": "Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd stars in THE LEGEND OF TARZAN - in theaters July 2016.\nhttp://legendoftarzan.com\nhttp://facebook.com/legendoftarzan\n\n---\nFrom Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures comes the action adventure \u201cThe Legend of Tarzan,\u201d starring Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd (HBO\u2019s \u201cTrue Blood\u201d) as the legendary character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. \n\nThe film also stars Oscar nominee Samuel L. Jackson (\u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d the \u201cCaptain America\u201d films), Margot Robbie (\u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d), Oscar nominee Djimon Hounsou (\u201cBlood Diamond,\u201d \u201cGladiator\u201d), Oscar nominee John Hurt (\u201cThe Elephant Man,\u201d the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d films), with Oscar winner Jim Broadbent (\u201cIris\u201d), and two-time Academy Award winner Christoph Waltz (\u201cInglourious Basterds,\u201d \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d).  \n\nIt has been years since the man once known as Tarzan (Skarsg\u00e5rd) left the jungles of Africa behind for a gentrified life as John Clayton III, Lord Greystoke, with his beloved wife, Jane (Robbie) at his side.  Now, he has been invited back to the Congo to serve as a trade emissary of Parliament, unaware that he is a pawn in a deadly convergence of greed and revenge, masterminded by the Belgian, Captain Leon Rom (Waltz).  But those behind the murderous plot have no idea what they are about to unleash.\n\nDavid Yates (the final four \u201cHarry Potter\u201d films, upcoming \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\u201d) directed \u201cThe Legend of Tarzan\u201d from a screenplay by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer, story by Brewer and Cozad based on the Tarzan stories created by Burroughs.  Legendary producer Jerry Weintraub (\u201cBehind the Candelabra,\u201d the \u201cOcean\u2019s\u201d trilogy) produced the film, together with David Barron (the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d films, \u201cCinderella\u201d), Alan Riche (\u201cSouthpaw\u201d) and Tony Ludwig (\u201cStarsky & Hutch\u201d).  Susan Ekins, Nikolas Korda, Keith Goldberg, David Yates, Mike Richardson and Bruce Berman served as executive producers.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Henry Braham (\u201cThe Golden Compass\u201d), Oscar-winning production designer Stuart Craig (\u201cDangerous Liaisons,\u201d \u201cThe English Patient,\u201d the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d films), editor Mark Day (\u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Parts 1 & 2\u201d), and Oscar-nominated costume designer Ruth Myers (\u201cEmma,\u201d \u201cUnknown\u201d).\n\u201cThe Legend of Tarzan\u201d was shot at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, as well as on location around the UK. \n\nA Jerry Weintraub production, \u201cThe Legend of Tarzan\u201d is slated for release on July 1, 2016.  The film will be distributed in 2D and 3D in select theatres and IMAX by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.",
