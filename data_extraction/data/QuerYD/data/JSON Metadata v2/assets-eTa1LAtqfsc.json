        "description": "Join Aaron as he plays Mudrunner, a game about trucking in the Ural mountains. He's getting his trucks setup for the last journey to the saw mill on this map.\r\n\r\nThis is made using a technique called \"Integrated Described Video\"; this means I will be trying to describe what's going on on-screen as it happens, allowing for viewers that are visually impaired (or just otherwise occupied, eg cooking) to follow along.\r\n\r\nI absolutely appreciate any and all feedback on it. Thank you!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWelcome to Yesterdays Games.
