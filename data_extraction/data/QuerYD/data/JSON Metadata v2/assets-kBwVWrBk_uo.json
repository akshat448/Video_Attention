I will be providing descriptions from the objective, emotional, and sociological perspectives. The following description is from the objective perspective. \n\nWe are about to enter a scene in which Mrs. Armitage, a white, affluent psychiatrist secretly hypnotizes Chris, an African American photographer who is also dating Mrs. Armitage\u2019s white daughter. Mrs. Armitage is sitting on a flowered chair across from Chris, who is sitting on a red leather armchair. \n\nChris stares back at Mrs. Armitage inquisitively and looks tortured as he thinks deeply. \n\nWe enter Chris\u2019s thoughts and see him as a child sitting criss-crossed in front of a TV. \n\nMrs. Armitage stirs her tea with a teaspoon. \n\nChris somberly stares ahead with dead eyes. \n\nPatronizing surprise \n\nChris vigorously scratches at the chair arms. \n\nHe cries with his eyes wide open, tears streaming down his face. \n\nChris falls suddenly and then in slow motion into the blackness away from Mrs. Armitage, who is now projected onto a screen. \n\nHe flails around in the darkness, seemingly an endless galaxy with stars. \n\nAs Chris falls, he looks up at the shrinking image of Mrs. Armitage. \n\nHe swims in the air, trying to claw his way back to reality but he continues to fall. \n\nHe has fallen far below Mrs. Armitage and stares up at her shrinking figure. \n\nSitting on the armchair, Chris cries wide-eyed, his mouth in an open gape. \n\nMrs. Armitage leans forward to look at Chris.\n\nChris, hypnotized, blinks helplessly at Mrs. Armitage as her shrinking image peers down to look at him. \n\nChris becomes desperate, flailing wildly, but unable to re-surface.\n\nShe places her hand on Chris's face and closes his eyelid. \n\nBlackness\n\nHe wakes up.\n",

I will be providing descriptions from the objective, emotional, and sociological perspectives. The following description is from the emotional perspective. \n\nWe are about to enter a scene in which Mrs. Armitage, a white, affluent psychiatrist secretly hypnotizes Chris, an African American photographer who is also dating Mrs. Armitage\u2019s white daughter. Mrs. Armitage is sitting on a flowered chair across from Chris, who is sitting on a red leather armchair.\n\nWatching Chris as a child sitting on the floor by himself in the dark, his basketball hoop in the corner, I feel so sorry for him and I can sense that he is trying his best to be distracted from his fear by watching TV. \n\nMrs. Armitage\u2019s gentle voice is belied by her condescending gaze and I feel extremely terrified of her. \n\nNothing. The guilt that Chris still harbors is palpable and I am extremely angry at Mrs. Armitage for manipulating him to feel that way. \n\nThis statement is extremely striking to me, how we can be stuck in a state of disillusionment because even as something is happening in real time, it doesn\u2019t become real to us until we begin to bear its consequences. \n\nWatching Chris as a child scratch at his wooden chair, I feel so sympathetic for him. He said that he did nothing, but he is letting his worry tear him apart, and that's something.\n\nAs Chris falls into the sunken place, the music that plays in the background makes me feel trapped, like someone is directing or orchestrating my actions and I am not in control. \n\nThe sound of the wind in the background reminds me how loud nothingness is, and I wonder if that\u2019s how death feels. \n\nChris crying with his eyes wide open is extremely jarring and I feel very disturbed. \n\nSeeing her hand touch his face, leaves me with goosebumps\n\nThe crescendo of noise at the end made me so afraid that something terrible was about to happen, and I felt relief seeing Chris waking up, until I realized that he is still in the Armitages' house.\n\n",

I will be providing descriptions from the objective, emotional, and sociological perspectives. The following description is from the sociological perspective. \n\nWe are about to enter a scene in which Mrs. Armitage, a white, affluent psychiatrist secretly hypnotizes Chris, an African American photographer who is also dating Mrs. Armitage\u2019s white daughter. Mrs. Armitage is sitting on a flowered chair across from Chris, who is sitting on a red leather armchair.\n\nChris stares back at Mrs. Armitage inquisitively and looks tortured as he thinks deeply. \n\nWe enter Chris\u2019s thoughts and see him as a child sitting criss-crossed in front of a TV. \n\nMrs. Armitage stirs her teacup with a silver teaspoon, hypnotizing Chris, but also mimicking slave masters, who summoned house slaves using tea cups. \n\nChris somberly stares ahead with dead eyes. \n\nPatronizing surprise. \n\nChris vigorously scratches at the armchair, which during a later scene is revealed to be stuffed with cotton, referencing the cotton that black slaves picked for hundreds of years. \n\nHe cries with his eyes wide open, tears streaming down his face. \n\nChris falls suddenly and then in slow motion into the blackness away from Mrs. Armitage, who is now projected onto a screen. \n\nHe is immobilized and powerless in the grips of Mrs. Armitage\u2019s trance. No matter how hard he screams, he is silenced, symbolizing Black repression in America, from slavery, to the Tuskegee experiments, to the death of Travyon Martin. \n\nWatching Mrs. Armitage on the screen and unable to surface back to reality, Chris parallels his younger self watching TV during his mom's death and doing nothing.\n\nAs he falls into nothingness, watching the outside world on a screen, the fourth wall is broken. Like Chris the audience in the movie theater is also sitting in the blackness, watching a scene play out with no agency to change it. \n\nHypnotized, Chris blinks helplessly at Mrs. Armitage as she peers down to look at him. \n\nThe sunken place is the system that silences blacks, the disabled, women and other oppressed groups. \n\nShe places her hand on Chris's face and closes his eyelid, rendering him helpless to even see reality. \n\n",
