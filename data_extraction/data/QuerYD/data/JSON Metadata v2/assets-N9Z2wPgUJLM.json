                "notes": "We see two finished origami foxes, complete with eyes and a mouth. One is yellow and the other is blue. A hand holds the yellow origami fox, moving it so that the viewer sees it from different angles.\r\n\r\nAn orange and black scene appears, showing an owl and a jack-o-lantern in a forest. The words \u201cHow to Dreams!\u201d appear with the eyes of the owl and jack-o-lantern glowing eerily in the background.\r\nThe video transitions into the origami tutorial. In this entire tutorial, we only see a person\u2019s hands doing the origami step-by-step while using a flat tabletop workspace to make the folds. \r\nWe see a yellow square piece of origami paper. The person demonstrates how to make the first fold by positioning the paper so that the origami paper square is a diamond shape directly in front of them, with one corner on the bottom and another directly on top. The bottom corner is brought up to meet the top corner and the first fold is made.\r\nThe paper now resembles a wide triangle.\r\nThe paper is unfolded and brought back to its original diamond shape. The left corner is lifted to meet the right corner and the second fold is made. \r\nThe paper is unfolded to show how the two creases look like a cross, meeting at the center of the paper.\r\nThe initial fold is repeated so that the paper resembles a wide triangle with the base of the triangle closest to the person\u2019s body.\r\nThe person now brings the left point of the triangle to meet up with the top point of the triangle. When these points are perfectly matched up, the fold is made.\r\nThe person now does the same fold on the right side, bringing the right point of the triangle to meet up with the top point.\r\nWe now see that there is a space in the center of the last two folds. The paper is folded in half along the center space so that this center space becomes the base crease of a smaller wide triangle.\r\nThe person positions the wide triangle so that the top point of the wide triangle is closest to their body. The triangle now consists of three folded edges OR flaps. The person then takes the right corner of the top two folded edges and lifts them to extend beyond the base of the triangle, folding them so that the raw edges form a vertical line at the center of the triangle. \r\nTRANSITION SPOT (not to be narrated\u2026)\r\n\u00b7         There are now two points, one on top of the other, that extend up beyond the upside down triangle base.\r\n\u00b7         The top point is moved back to the right. There are now two folded edges or flaps on top of the upside down triangle. \r\n\u00b7         All creases are made to be precise\r\n\u00b7         The fingers start at the top right corner of the flap on the right . The raw edges of this flap are opened up and separated. Then, the top tip of the opened flap is folded down.\u00b7     \r\n           This fold forms a small diamond shape that creates the fox\u2019s face.\r\n\u00b7         \r\n\u00b7         The folded paper is picked up and all folds and creases are pressed precisely. Then, it is placed back on the tabletop workspace.\r\n\u00b7         The bottom right corner of the former wide triangle is folded  in towards the top tip of the wide triangle so that it is flush with the right side of the triangle. This is the fox\u2019s tail.\r\n\u00b7        The folds are now complete!  \r\nA black pen is used to color the nose. An arc is drawn from left to right  about \u2153 of an inch up from the bottom point of the diamond shaped face, the blank space underneath the semi circle or arc is filled in with marker. \r\n\u00b7         We can see a crease in the middle of the fox\u2019s face.\r\n\u00b7         The eyes are now drawn by making small arcs from left to right, about 1 inch up from the bottom point of the nose. Fist, on the left side of the face, or crease,  and then on the right side.\r\n\u00b7         The black pen is moved out of sight and the origami fox is picked up.\r\n\u00b7         It is placed standing up and supported by the folded tail, on the left side of the screen.\r\n\u00b7         A blue origami fox, that we can assume was previously made, is placed on the right of the yellow one.\r\n\r\n\u00b7        \r\n\u00b7         The screen fades into the original eery black and orange screen and \r\n\u00b7         The words \u201cHow To Dreams.!\u201d appear on the screen.",
