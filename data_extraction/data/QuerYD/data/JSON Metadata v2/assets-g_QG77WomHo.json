The title appears under and it is Paint The Town\n\nFunky music plays in the background as the artist, Frank Ape, walks in an alleyway. Scenes show him painting on different canvases on the floor and observing his many large works on paper on the wall. It then cuts to him also speaking in his colorful studio space.\n\nWorkers hoisting different metal equipment\nThe artist stands on a glass balcony and observes as people are working on getting the tall scaffolding built up for the mural wall\nThe camera then pans up the tall blank white mural wall as the artist looks on from the bottom.\n\nThe camera takes close up shots and pans over different painting equipments. The artist is then seen holding a graffiti can while looking at the planned mural draft on a piece 8.5 x 11\" of paper in his hand. The draft shows a blue sky with white clouds and a gray cityscape with a white ape painting an orange streak.\n\nA close up shot of the artist shows him looking up as he fixes his glasses. Then it cuts to  Javier, the managing director of arlo hotels, speaking in a hotel guestroom while the mural is visible outside of the window in the background. As Javier continues to speak, there are many different graffiti tags and wall art around New York City being shown.\n\nDrone shots show a birds eye view of Arlo SoHo hotel courtyard and then the next shot shows the rooftop packed with guests. The artist is seen greeting people and hanging out grabbing drinks at the rooftop space while Javier is also there enjoying the moment.\n\nThe artist along with a colleague are looking up at the wall while talking amongst themselves, planning the mural. The next scene shows artist talking as he takes a paint roller in white paint and begins his craft. The artist then begins climbing up the scaffolding levels to spray paint different parts of the mural, occasionally shaking the spray cans, while drum music plays in the background. The blue sky, the tagline Paint The Town, and the black outlines of the Ape imagery begins to come together.\n\nJavier, while on the balcony of hotel guestroom, finally sees the finish mural, which is a blue sky with the tagline Paint The Town, under it a white cityscape and a U-shaped blue stroke under that, and a stylized Frank the Ape paints a giant orange streak down the cityscape\n\nThe camera zooms out and slowly pans up the full width and height of the mural and in the same frame, Arlo SoHo guestroom windows are visible to the left and manhattan streets to the right, really showing how large and captivating the mural is. \n\nThen Arlo SoHo logo is shown on a black background as end credits begin to roll.\n\nProducer is Chrissy Cox and Dayna Castano\nDirector is Gladimir Gelin and Hayden Hoyl\nEditor is Hayden Hoyl\nArtist is Frank Ape\nSpecial Thanks to Javier Egipciaco\n\nNew York Made Arlo SoHo and Beyond Production House logos show at the bottom\n\n--End--\n\n",
