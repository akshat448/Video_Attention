                "notes": "Jerry comes out of his mouse hole and sees a block of cheese with a string tied around it. Curious, he tries to take it, only for the block to move away each time Jerry is close, this time being yanked behind the corner of a wall. Jerry turns the corner only to find Tom at the other end of the string dropping an iron from his hand. Jerry quickly moves Tom\u2019s foot underneath the falling iron, and bolts up the stairs. \nTom chases after him, first up the stairs, then down the railing as well, only for Jerry to switch to the other railing at the last second. This sends Tom flying into the wall, a cuckoo clock smashes onto his head. Tom again chases after Jerry, this time sucking him back with a fireplace bellow. Tom plays with jerry and tosses him up and down using the bellow. On his second time in the air, Jerry grabs hold of a plate. After falling down, he smashes tom in the head with it. He runs off and hides in a bottle placed in a Chemistry Set. \n\nAfter Tom is gone, Jerry sticks his head out of the bottle labeled: \u201cinvisible ink\u201d. Jerry slowly realizes that he cannot see the rest of his body but it is still there. He reads the label, dips his hand in, and sure enough his hand disappears in front of him. Delighted, Jerry dives into the bottle headfirst. The camera pans and centers on an invisible Jerry, the first clue being the stamp moving as if someone is walking over it. Still invisible, Jerry\u2019s eye catches a plate of chocolate sweets. First, one of the sweets is lifted into the air, a bite mark appears and the rest of the sweet vanishes. One by one, the plate is emptied by invisible jerry. He then walks over to the edge of the table and using a ruler as a diving board, jumps onto a pillow on a chair. Impressions of Jerry appear as he walks, first on the pillow, followed by the armrest cover, which he then uses to parachute to the ground. Jerry\u2019s impression appears in the curtains, from where he sees tom again setting up the cheese and iron trap from earlier. This time jerry eats the block of cheese while Tom watches in disbelief as a block of cheese seemingly disappeared into thin air. He sets the iron down on a table, only for him to see it lift into the air and drop onto his foot. While the iron distracts him, Jerry grabs tom\u2019s tail and puts it into an electrical outlet, shocking tom who bolts from there. \n\nExhausted tom decides to drink some milk from his bowl. Just as he\u2019s about to drink, the bowl moves out of the way. Tom rubs his eyes in disbelief, during which the bowl is moved back by Jerry to its original position. Still unsure of whats going on, Tom tries to take another drink of the milk, only for it to be slurped into thin air. He lifts the bowl to make sure that this is really happening. A final drop is also slurped by Jerry who then spits it into Tom\u2019s face. Tom runs to the mirror in shock, checking himself in the mirror to make sure that he isn\u2019t sick or going crazy. \n\nWeary and defeated, Tom sets up a pillow to lay down and tries to relax. A floating packet of matches makes its way towards tom\u2019s foot. First Jerry gets out just one match and sticks it in between Tom\u2019s toes but changes his mind and switches the match with the entire packet of matches, lighting the packet with the match. Tom wakes up sweaty from the heat of the fire, sees the smoke, doesn\u2019t make too much of it and goes back to sleep. He then smells the smoke and realizes his foot is on fire, sending him into a panic. He runs over to a fish bowl by a piano and sticks his burning foot inside the bowl. While sitting on the piano bench and fanning his burned foot, a few of the piano's keys are being played. Tom gets up on the edge and look inside the piano to see what is making the noise. Jerry pulls the stand holding the top of the piano up, causing it to slam down on tom whose head gets slammed into his neck. Tom's head finally pop's back out but Tom still remains confused about whats going on.\n",
