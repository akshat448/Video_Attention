        "description": "https://www.expedia.com/Salzburg.d180020.Destination-Travel-Guides\r\n\r\nThe Austrian city of Salzburg is situated on the northern edge of the Alps, close to the border of Germany. Surrounded by lakes and mountains, and straddling the banks of the Salzach River, few cities can match Salzburg\u2019s fairytale setting.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFew places can match its musical heritage either. Salzburg is the hometown of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and\u00a0provided the settings for one of cinema\u2019s most-adored musicals, The Sound Of Music. \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nTake the funicular to Hohensalzburg, one of Europe\u2019s best-preserved medieval fortresses. Down below in the Old Town you\u2019ll find Salzburg Cathedral and the Salzburg Museum. Nearby, wander along narrow Getreidegasse, one of the loveliest shopping streets in the world. \r\n\u00a0\r\nJust off the Old Market Square, savor 300 years of coffee-making tradition at Caf\u00e9 Tomaselli. For classical Austrian fare served with a side of Opera, take the short walk to Stiftskeller St. Peter. At the M\u00fcllner Br\u00e4u Brewery, hang out with beer devotees from all over the world.\u00a0\r\n \r\nSalzburg has long been a city where inspiration knows no bounds, especially when it comes to its palaces. Just a short stroll from the Marionette Theater, the grandeur of Mirabell Palace and Gardens awaits. While on Salzburg\u2019s southern outskirts, explore the playful water features at Hellbrunn Palace.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhile Salzburg abounds with fountains, some of the city\u2019s most impressive water features are its natural ones, such as Lake Wolfgang and Krimml Waterfall. For a waterfall with a difference, visit the spa town of Bad Gastein, whose falls roar straight through the heart of town. From the town, take the cable car to the summit of Stubnerkogel Mountain and walk Europe\u2019s highest suspension bridge.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Salzburg region is full of surprises, so before heading back to the city, head underground, into the Hallein Salt Mine. From its salt mines to its symphonies, from its fountains to its waterfalls, Salzburg plays out like a living opera, filled with drama, comedy, intrigue and passion.",
