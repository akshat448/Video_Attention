You only need a pea-sized dab of paste to do the job.\n\nTip\nAdults should always use toothpaste with fluoride to fight tooth decay.\n\nStep 2: Angle brush\nHold the toothbrush against your gums with the bristles at a 45-degree angle.\n\nStep 3: Move in circles\nMove the brush in small circles using short gentle motions, making sure that you get under the gum line as much as possible. But don't brush too roughly\u2014it may cause your gums to bleed.\n\nStep 4: Brush all surfaces\nMake sure you brush the top, front and back surfaces of each tooth. Don't forget your back molars. You should brush your teeth for 2 to 3 minutes.\n\nTip\nPick a favorite song 2 to 3 minutes long and brush along to it to make brushing fun, not tedious.\n\nStep 5: Behind front teeth\nTo brush behind your front teeth, use the front tip of your brush and angle the bristles at a 60-degree angle. Brush gently up and down.\n\nStep 6: Brush top of tongue\nBefore rinsing your toothbrush, gently brush the top of your tongue to help get rid of bacteria and freshen your breath.\n\nTip\nIt's recommended that you replace your toothbrush every 2 weeks to 3 months\u2014or whenever you've been sick\u2014to keep harmful bacteria from building up.\n\nStep 7: Rinse mouth\nRinse your mouth out with mouthwash or water and smile, baby!\n\nDid You Know?\nPrince Charles's valet squeezes his toothpaste onto his toothbrush for him.",
