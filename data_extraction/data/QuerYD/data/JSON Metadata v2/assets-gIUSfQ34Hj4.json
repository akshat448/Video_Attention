In most cases, the cleaning agent comes dissolved in a liquid. The liquid solution is massaged into wet hair, and creates a lather that breaks up deposits of oil and dirt. The lather is then rinsed from the hair after a few minutes, leaving the hair clean.Shampoos have a number of qualities that should be considered before use. How well a shampoo cleans is very important, and individual brands usually come in slightly different formulations for either \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201coily\u201d hair. The fragrance that a shampoo leaves in the hair is also a major consideration, and is why scented shampoos are so popular. Other factors often taken into account include how shiny the shampoo makes the hair, possible irritation of the scalp, toxicity, price, if organic ingredients have been used, and whether or not the shampoo has been tested on animals.\r\nWhat is Shaving Foam;a soft soapy substance which you put on your face or body before removing hair with a razor\r\nAbout Slime: \r\nSlime was a toy product manufactured by pillo, sold in a plastic trash can and introduced in the winter of 1976. It consisted of a non-toxic viscous, squishy and oozy green or other color material made primarily from guar gum.[1] Different variations of Slime were released over the years, including Slime containing rubber insects, eyeballs, and worms and Masters of the Universe Slime for Hordak's Slime Pit playset in the 1980s.\r\nThe late 1970s also introduced a Slime Monster board game; the object of the game was to avoid having your game piece slimed on by a foot-tall plastic monster that had slime oozing from its mouth. Other toy companies have produced their own slime such as the Ecto-Plazm play gel[2] sold with select figures in Kenner's Real Ghostbusters toyline. Playmates' Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles figure line also had Retro-Mutagen slime sold in containers and included with playsets.\r\nhe main components are the polysaccharide guar gum and sodium tetraborate. As an alternative to the polysaccharide, other alcohol-group containing polymers (such as polyvinyl alcohol) may be used to a similar result. These non-polysacharide polymer products are more often referred to as flubber.\r\nPolyvinyl acetate (Elmer's glue), borax and water can also be used to approximate Slime's characteristics.\r\nPlease join to my channel from link below;\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCncW1mTN8mgKo4g9D8im-_A  \r\n\r\nHoppiTV : \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRzJw3ZtTiQJNAAGxzH-2dQ  \r\nFunnyKids TV : \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UClwXPc317YSIXbSxYREy5Lg  \r\n\r\nBesides Slime With Shampoo,Salt and Shaving Foam, No Glue,No Borax Slime Recipe, 3 Ingredients Slime you can also have a look; \r\nREAL !!
