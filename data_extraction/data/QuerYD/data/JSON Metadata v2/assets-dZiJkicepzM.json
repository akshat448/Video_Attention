                "notes": "mason is an ancient battled scarred feral cat with advanced kidney disease.\n\nA seated, large, brown tabby cat with yellow eyes stares proudly forward \n\nHe also had a badly injured foot, several abscessed teeth and was quite fierce.\na hand reaches out to pet the mason- he hisses and swats.\n\nNearly 100% of feral cats admitted to shelters are euthanized, simply because they are feral. Mason's yellow eyes are open wide in his wary feline face.\n\nWe believe Mason deserved to live his sunset months in comfort, free from pain. Mason sits upright with a big red cast on his right front paw\n\n\nA few months later he was adapting remarkably well to life in a home. mason plays with a feather toy on the end of a wand.\n\nHe was still fierce when we tried to pet him, but was clearly happy to be alive.\n\nWe thought that was as good as it could get for this magnificent former feral.\n\n\nAnd then we brought home some foster kittens, and something remarkable happened...\n\nMason in a brown furr kitty bed under a piece of furniture. Two unsteady kittens  one brown tabby, and one ginger striped walk towards him, \n\nMason sniffs them gently\n\nThe orange kitten licks and bites at Masons ears, the brown tabby kitten snuggles in the bed at his side. \nmason closes his eyes, ears forward, relaxed.\n\nThe orange kitten climbs into the bed, starts to cuddle up with mason and the brown tabby kitten. He settles with his paws wrapped around Masons neck. They all sink deeper into sleep. mason's head comes down to rest on the pile of tiny kittens. \n\nsee what happens on our 24/7 live rescue kitten TV tinykittens.com\n\nTiny kittens, rescue kitten TV Rescuing locally, educating globally. \n\n",

Instead of euthanasia, we felt he deserved to live his sunset months in comfort, free from pain.\r\n\r\nWhat happened next will make your heart melt.  \r\n\r\nSee additional videos of the adorable interactions between Grandpa Mason and \"his\" foster kittens at TinyTuxies. And please remember that spaying and neutering is the only way to prevent unwanted cats and kittens like Mason and \"his\" kittens from being born and suffering. Contact your local shelter or SPCA if you need assistance with spaying and neutering... most have free or low cost programs, and are happy to help.\r\n\r\nMore about the rescue work we do: TinyKittens.com",
