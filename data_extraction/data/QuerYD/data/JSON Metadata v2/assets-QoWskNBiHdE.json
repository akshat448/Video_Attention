One of the females is sitting in a motorised wheelchair. They have 2 opened packets of Maltesers.\r\n\r\n0:30:05: The two people without disability are keenly listening to the wheelchair-user whilst smiling and giggling. \r\n\r\n0:41:50: The facial expressions of the two people without disability have changed to horror and concern as they continue listening. \r\n\r\n0:47:40: The person with a disability's left hand (which is holding a packet of opened Maltesers) starts to spasm and she shakes the packet of Maltesers until Maltesers spill out of the top of the packet and land on the table. This is an innuendo for performing a sex act and the male ejaculating. \r\n\r\n0:58:50: The United Nations logo appears before \"15%\" is displayed in the centre. \r\n\r\n1:15:52: A black and white symbol of a wheelchair user is beginning to be covered up by proliferating Maltesers until the whole screen is covered by the chocolate product. The words \"SYMBOLIC ANNIHILATION\" appear over the Maltesers. \r\n\r\n1:28:11: The words \"SYMBOLIC ANNIHILATION\" disappear and the Maltesers all drop revealing the black and white symbol of a wheelchair-user. \r\n\r\n1:35:22: The screen changes to a red background. Two Maltesers appear in the top left corner of the screen. Cartoon eyes overlay these Maltesers. The eyes then rotate 180\u00ba so that they're looking to the RHS of the screen. \r\n\r\n1:44:85: The cartoon eyes disappear and the red background changes into Maltesers branding with the word \"Maltesers\" surrounded by some of the chocolate product. \r\n\r\n1:51:56: Black and white footage of a puppet is shown. A hand enters the frame and cuts one of its strings using scissors. The puppet then falls to the ground. \r\n\r\n2:14:50: A still from the advertisement showing the three females sitting at a table eating Maltesers is shown. Question marks appear over the 2 people without disability. Smaller question marks are then shown travelling from each of the people without disability towards the person with disability. The person with disability is then covered by question marks. \r\n\r\n2:26:21: Old black and white footage of a young boy wearing a bowtie using crutches and wearing leg braces. The footage first shows the crutches and leg braces and finishes with the top half of the boy smiling to something off camera. The boy appears to be having a good time. \r\n\r\n2:31:70: A photo of the actress from the advertisement sitting in a wheelchair in front of a wall with the words \"BOX OFFICE\" painted on it. ",
