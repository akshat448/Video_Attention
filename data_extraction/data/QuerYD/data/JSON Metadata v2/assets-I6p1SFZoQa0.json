Set in a theatre\u2019s dressing room, TY5 host Tami Dixon asks 5 questions to some of Pittsburgh\u2019s favorite theatre artists in order to evoke memory, dreams and meaning under the guise of an informal \u201cpre-show\u201d dressing room chat.\n\nThe term \u2018thank you, 5\u2019 is traditional theatre lingo spoken in theaters all over the planet. Before a show the stage manager (SM) visits each dressing room giving \u2018call times\u2019 to the actors. When the SM gives the \u20185 minutes to places\u2019 call the actors respond with \u201cthank you 5!\u201d\n\nChrystal Bates has the distinction of being a three time consecutive winner of the Onyx Award for Best Actress and the first recipient of the Donna Award for best actress.
